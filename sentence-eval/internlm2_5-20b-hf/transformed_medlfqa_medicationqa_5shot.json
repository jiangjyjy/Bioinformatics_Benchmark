        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch\nAnswer: There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how often do you need a zoster vaccine?\nAnswer: People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine (Zostavax). They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over Zostavax.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to administer denosumab\nAnswer: Denosumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in your upper arm, upper thigh, or stomach area. It is usually injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. Denosumab injection (Prolia) is usually given once every 6 months. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to reduce the risk of fractures from multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread to the bones, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to treat giant cell tumor of bone, or high calcium levels caused by cancer, it is usually given every 7 days for the first three doses (on day 1, day 8, and day 15) and then once every 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after the first three doses.Your doctor will tell you to take supplements of calcium and vitamin D while you are being treated with denosumab injection. Take these supplements exactly as directed.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: warfarin and cabbage?\nAnswer: Some foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. Make sure you check with your provider before making any big changes in your diet.You do not have to avoid these foods, but try to eat or drink only small amounts of them.

However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch\nAnswer: There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: why did my doctor give me levetiracetam\n\nAnswer: Levetiracetam Extended-release Tablets is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 12 years of age and older with epilepsy.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: is pramipexole addictive?\nAnswer: you should know that some people who took medications such as pramipexole to treat Parkinson's disease or restless legs syndrome developed gambling problems, an increased interest in shopping or sex, overeating problems, or other intense urges or behaviors that were compulsive or unusual for them. There is not enough information to tell whether the people developed these problems because they took the medication or for other reasons. Call your doctor if you develop intense urges or have difficulty controlling any of these behaviors. Tell your family members about these risks so that they can call the doctor even if you do not realize that your behavior has become a problem.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: heroin mixed with fentanyl what are the symptoms of an overdose\nAnswer: People use heroin to get high. But if they overdose on it, they get extremely sleepy or may become unconsciousness and stop breathing.Below are symptoms of a heroin overdose in different parts of the body.Symptoms include:- Slow and shallow breathing\n- Deceased pulse rate\n- Exhaustion, to the point of potentially losing consciousness\n- Bluish lips and fingernails\n- Skin turning cold and clammy \n- Pinpoint pupils \n- Delirium, disorientation or coma\n- Nausea and vomiting.When heroin is mixed with fentanyl, an overdose can occur more easily because fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin. Also, symptoms of an overdose might occur rapidly after drug use due to fentanyl's potency.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to reduce bisoprolol\n\nAnswer: Cessation of Therapy\nIf withdrawal of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks.\n\n\nMedication Question: how often do you need a zoster vaccine?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how do steroids effect the digestive system\nAnswer: teroid abuse can also be hepatotoxic, promoting disturbances such as biliary stasis, peliosis hepatis, and even hepatomas, which are all usually reversible upon discontinuation.Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, can have a significant impact on the digestive system. One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is magnesium chelated good for\nAnswer: Chelated magnesium is used as a supplement to maintain adequate magnesium in the body.Magnesium plays a key role in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body, including those involved in the synthesis of protein, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation.

Dextroamphetamine is also used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep). Dextroamphetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: marijuana is what schedule drug\n\nAnswer: Cannabis , also known as marijuana, is a plant grown in many parts of the world which produces a resin containing compounds called cannabinoids.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: can i eat after taking rapaflo?\n\nAnswer: The recommended dose is 8 mg orally once daily with a meal.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how long should i take dutasteride\n\nAnswer: We strongly recommend that physicians discuss with their patients these potential serious adverse effects of long-term dutasteride therapy prior to instituting this form of treatment.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is prochlorperazine\nAnswer: For control of severe nausea and vomiting.Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how long will 6 mgs of suboxone block opiates\nAnswer: Comparisons of buprenorphine with full agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.In non-dependent subjects, acute sublingual doses of SUBOXONE tablets produced opioid agonist effects, which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg and 16mg of SUBUTEX. The effects of 16mg SUBOXONE were similar to those produced by 16mg SUBUTEX (buprenorphine alone).\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how often do you need a zoster vaccine?\nAnswer: People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine (Zostavax). They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over Zostavax.\n\n\nMedication Question: what is rate for iv infusion cilastatin/imipenem\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: cbd from marijuana to treat what\nAnswer: Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the laboratory and the clinic for relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite (see Question 6 and Question 7).\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how do steroids effect the digestive system\nAnswer: teroid abuse can also be hepatotoxic, promoting disturbances such as biliary stasis, peliosis hepatis, and even hepatomas, which are all usually reversible upon discontinuation.Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, can have a significant impact on the digestive system. One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: is dronabinol marijuana how much are ten mg pills worth\nAnswer: The cost for dronabinol oral capsule 2.5 mg is around $94 for a supply of 60 capsules, depending on the pharmacy you visit.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how dextroamphetamine works\nAnswer: Dextroamphetamine is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in adults and children. Dextroamphetamine is also used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep). Dextroamphetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch\nAnswer: There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend.

            "Analysis:\n1. Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that works by inhibiting the production of certain clotting factors in the liver, thus preventing the formation of blood clots.\n2. Cabbage contains high levels of vitamin K, which is a crucial component for blood clotting and plays a role in the synthesis of clotting factors.\n3. When a person consumes large amounts of vitamin K-rich foods like cabbage, it can counteract the effect of warfarin by increasing the production of clotting factors, potentially leading to an increased risk of blood clots.\n\nFinal answer: Consuming cabbage while taking warfarin can potentially interfere with the medication's effectiveness, as cabbage is rich in vitamin K, which is involved in blood clotting. This may lead to an increased risk of blood clots. It is important for individuals taking warfarin to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K-rich foods and to consult with their healthcare provider about the appropriate amount of cabbage or other vitamin K-rich foods to consume while on this medication."

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: marijuana is what schedule drug\n\nAnswer: Cannabis , also known as marijuana, is a plant grown in many parts of the world which produces a resin containing compounds called cannabinoids. Some cannabinoids are psychoactive (acting on the brain and changing mood or consciousness) (see Question 1).\nThe use of Cannabis for medicinal purposes dates back to ancient times (see Question 3).\nBy federal law, the possession of Cannabis is illegal in the United States outside of approved research settings. However, a growing number of states, territories, and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to legalize medical marijuana (see Question 1).\nIn the United States, Cannabis is a controlled substance requiring special licensing for its use (see Question 1 and Question 3).\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: is dronabinol marijuana how much are ten mg pills worth\nAnswer: The cost for dronabinol oral capsule 2.5 mg is around $94 for a supply of 60 capsules, depending on the pharmacy you visit.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is prochlorperazine\nAnswer: For control of severe nausea and vomiting.Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what class is diazepam\n\nAnswer: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how dextroamphetamine works\nAnswer: Dextroamphetamine is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in adults and children. Dextroamphetamine is also used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep). Dextroamphetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants.

It is usually injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. Denosumab injection (Prolia) is usually given once every 6 months. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to reduce the risk of fractures from multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread to the bones, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to treat giant cell tumor of bone, or high calcium levels caused by cancer, it is usually given every 7 days for the first three doses (on day 1, day 8, and day 15) and then once every 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after the first three doses.Your doctor will tell you to take supplements of calcium and vitamin D while you are being treated with denosumab injection. Take these supplements exactly as directed.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: heroin mixed with fentanyl what are the symptoms of an overdose\nAnswer: People use heroin to get high. But if they overdose on it, they get extremely sleepy or may become unconsciousness and stop breathing.Below are symptoms of a heroin overdose in different parts of the body.Symptoms include:- Slow and shallow breathing\n- Deceased pulse rate\n- Exhaustion, to the point of potentially losing consciousness\n- Bluish lips and fingernails\n- Skin turning cold and clammy \n- Pinpoint pupils \n- Delirium, disorientation or coma\n- Nausea and vomiting.When heroin is mixed with fentanyl, an overdose can occur more easily because fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin. Also, symptoms of an overdose might occur rapidly after drug use due to fentanyl's potency.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how often do you need a zoster vaccine?\nAnswer: People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine (Zostavax). They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how other inject cortisone to the knee\n\nAnswer: A steroid injection is a shot of medicine used to relieve a swollen or inflamed area that is often painful. It can be injected into a joint, tendon, or bursa.\n\nDescription\nYour health care provider inserts a small needle and injects medicine into the painful and inflamed area. Depending on the site, your provider may use an x-ray or ultrasound to see where to place the needle.\n\nFor this procedure:\n\nYou will lie on a table and the injection area will be cleaned.\nA numbing medicine may be applied to the injection site.\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax.\nSteroid injections can be given into a bursa, joint, or tendon.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch\nAnswer: There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how is cyanocobalamin adminitsered\n\nAnswer: Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Each mL contains 1000 mcg cyanocobalamin.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how do steroids effect the digestive system\nAnswer: teroid abuse can also be hepatotoxic, promoting disturbances such as biliary stasis, peliosis hepatis, and even hepatomas, which are all usually reversible upon discontinuation.Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, can have a significant impact on the digestive system. One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is prochlorperazine\nAnswer: For control of severe nausea and vomiting.Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n\n\nMedication Question: how to administer denosumab\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: is dronabinol marijuana how much are ten mg pills worth\nAnswer: The cost for dronabinol oral capsule 2.5 mg is around $94 for a supply of 60 capsules, depending on the pharmacy you visit.\n\n\nMedication Question: it is latanoprost a cholinergic?\n\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: where does fluorouracil come from\nAnswer: dailymed list of manufacturersFluorouracil, also known as 5-FU, is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of cancer. It is a synthetic compound classified as an antimetabolite. Fluorouracil is made in pharmaceutical laboratories and is not naturally occurring. The manufacture of fluorouracil begins with the reaction of uracil with phosphorus oxychloride to produce 2,4-dichloropyrimidine, which is then substituted with fluorine to create fluorouracil.Some of the well-known manufacturers of fluorouracil include Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Ltd., among others. It is always important to ensure that the medication is produced by a reputable and trusted manufacturer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how do steroids effect the digestive system\nAnswer: teroid abuse can also be hepatotoxic, promoting disturbances such as biliary stasis, peliosis hepatis, and even hepatomas, which are all usually reversible upon discontinuation.Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, can have a significant impact on the digestive system. One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what are steroids\nAnswer: any of various compounds containing a 17-carbon 4-ring system and including the sterols and numerous hormones (such as anabolic steroids or corticosteroids) and glycosides\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how long does ecstasy or mda leave your body\nAnswer: In terms of its metabolism, research suggests that MDMA taken by mouth reaches its maximal blood concentration in about two hours.

However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder.

They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN.

Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how long does ecstasy or mda leave your body\nAnswer: In terms of its metabolism, research suggests that MDMA taken by mouth reaches its maximal blood concentration in about two hours. As ecstasy is metabolized, it is secreted into the urine and can be present for up to two days.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is magnesium chelated good for\nAnswer: Chelated magnesium is used as a supplement to maintain adequate magnesium in the body.Magnesium plays a key role in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body, including those involved in the synthesis of protein, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. It is also essential for bone health and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione.Chelated magnesium is a type of magnesium salt that has been chemically bound to a chelating agent, which is a substance that can bond with metals and minerals, increasing their absorption in the body. Therefore, compared to other forms of magnesium, chelated magnesium is more easily and efficiently absorbed by the body.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: vit b12 tabet?\nAnswer: Vitamin B12 is found in almost all multivitamins. Dietary supplements that contain only vitamin B12, or vitamin B12 with nutrients such as folic acid and other B vitamins, are also available. Check the Supplement Facts label to determine the amount of vitamin B12 provided.Vitamin B12 is also available in sublingual forms (which are dissolved under the tongue). There is no evidence that sublingual forms are better absorbed than pills that are swallowed.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: is viagra a treament for cor pulmonale?\n\nAnswer: Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\nMedication Question: how is tetracycline metabolized?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how long does ecstasy or mda leave your body\nAnswer: In terms of its metabolism, research suggests that MDMA taken by mouth reaches its maximal blood concentration in about two hours.

One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines.

Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch\nAnswer: There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to reduce bisoprolol\n\nAnswer: Cessation of Therapy\nIf withdrawal of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how to stop taking amlodipine\n\nAnswer: Continue to take amlodipine even if you feel well.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following question about medication and provide a detailed answer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: where does fluorouracil come from\nAnswer: dailymed list of manufacturersFluorouracil, also known as 5-FU, is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of cancer. It is a synthetic compound classified as an antimetabolite. Fluorouracil is made in pharmaceutical laboratories and is not naturally occurring. The manufacture of fluorouracil begins with the reaction of uracil with phosphorus oxychloride to produce 2,4-dichloropyrimidine, which is then substituted with fluorine to create fluorouracil.Some of the well-known manufacturers of fluorouracil include Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Ltd., among others. It is always important to ensure that the medication is produced by a reputable and trusted manufacturer.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: heroin mixed with fentanyl what are the symptoms of an overdose\nAnswer: People use heroin to get high. But if they overdose on it, they get extremely sleepy or may become unconsciousness and stop breathing.Below are symptoms of a heroin overdose in different parts of the body.Symptoms include:- Slow and shallow breathing\n- Deceased pulse rate\n- Exhaustion, to the point of potentially losing consciousness\n- Bluish lips and fingernails\n- Skin turning cold and clammy \n- Pinpoint pupils \n- Delirium, disorientation or coma\n- Nausea and vomiting.When heroin is mixed with fentanyl, an overdose can occur more easily because fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin. Also, symptoms of an overdose might occur rapidly after drug use due to fentanyl's potency.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what is magnesium chelated good for\nAnswer: Chelated magnesium is used as a supplement to maintain adequate magnesium in the body.Magnesium plays a key role in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body, including those involved in the synthesis of protein, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. It is also essential for bone health and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione.Chelated magnesium is a type of magnesium salt that has been chemically bound to a chelating agent, which is a substance that can bond with metals and minerals, increasing their absorption in the body. Therefore, compared to other forms of magnesium, chelated magnesium is more easily and efficiently absorbed by the body.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: what class is diazepam\n\nAnswer: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects.\n\nExample:\nMedication Question: how often do you need a zoster vaccine?\nAnswer: People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine (Zostavax). They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over Zostavax.\n\n\nMedication Question: what does using fluorouracil make your face look like\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.
