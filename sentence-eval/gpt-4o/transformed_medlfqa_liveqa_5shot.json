Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does one taper off the drug Amlodipine and start Atenolol to avoid adverse side effects?\nAnswer: Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks. Do not abruptly discontinue without physician's advice.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Define Syncope (ischemic stroke)?\nAnswer: 1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Are confusion and facial itch possible side effects of methadone?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Definition and Pathophysiology**: Understanding what Schmorl's nodes are and how they form is crucial. They are related to the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies.\n2. **Clinical Significance**: Determining whether Schmorl's nodes are symptomatic or asymptomatic and their potential impact on the patient's health.\n3. **Diagnosis**: Identifying how Schmorl's nodes are diagnosed, typically through imaging studies.\n4. **Treatment and Management**: Discussing the treatment options available if Schmorl's nodes are symptomatic or associated with other conditions.\n\nFinal answer:\nSchmorl's nodes are vertical herniations of the intervertebral disc material into the vertebral body. They are named after the German pathologist Christian Georg Schmorl, who first described them. These nodes occur when the nucleus pulposus (the inner core of the intervertebral disc) pushes through the cartilage endplate and into the adjacent vertebra.\n\n1. **Definition and Pathophysiology**: Schmorl's nodes are essentially small herniations of the disc material into the vertebral body. This can happen due to various reasons, including trauma, degenerative disc disease, or congenital weaknesses in the vertebral endplates.\n\n2. **Clinical Significance**: Schmorl's nodes are often found incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons and may not cause any symptoms. However, in some cases, they can be associated with back pain, particularly if they are large or if there is an inflammatory response in the surrounding bone. They are more commonly seen in individuals with conditions like Scheuermann's disease, which is a type of juvenile osteochondrosis of the spine.\n\n3. **Diagnosis**: Schmorl's nodes are typically diagnosed through imaging studies such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans. MRI is particularly useful as it can provide detailed images of both the bone and the soft tissues, helping to assess any associated inflammation or other spinal abnormalities.\n\n4. **Treatment and Management**: If Schmorl's nodes are asymptomatic, no specific treatment is usually required. However, if they are associated with pain or other symptoms, treatment may include:\n   - **Pain Management**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other pain relievers.\n   - **Physical Therapy**: Exercises to strengthen the back muscles and improve flexibility.\n   - **Lifestyle Modifications**: Recommendations may include avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain, maintaining a healthy weight, and practicing good posture.\n   - **Interventional Procedures**: In rare cases, if conservative treatments fail, procedures such as spinal injections or even surgery might be considered, although this is uncommon.\n\nIn summary, Schmorl's nodes are herniations of disc material into the vertebral body, often asymptomatic and found incidentally. They can be associated with back pain and other conditions like Scheuermann's disease. Diagnosis is typically through imaging studies, and treatment focuses on symptom management and conservative measures."

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\nAnswer: Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is the shingles virus contagious in the workplace, especially where food is being prepared?\nAnswer: Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What are the most common ways of spreading cold germs?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Nature of Cold Germs**: The common cold is primarily caused by viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most prevalent. These viruses are highly contagious and can spread easily from person to person.\n2. **Modes of Transmission**: Cold viruses can spread through several pathways, including direct contact, airborne transmission, and surface contamination.\n3. **Direct Contact**: This involves physical touch, such as shaking hands with someone who has the virus on their hands.\n4. **Airborne Transmission**: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets containing the virus into the air, which can then be inhaled by others.\n5. **Surface Contamination**: Viruses can survive on surfaces for several hours. Touching a contaminated surface and then touching the face, especially the nose or mouth, can lead to infection.\n6. **Preventive Measures**: Understanding these modes of transmission helps in implementing effective preventive measures such as hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and surface disinfection.\n\nFinal answer: The most common ways of spreading cold germs include direct contact, airborne transmission, and surface contamination. Direct contact occurs when an infected person touches another person, such as through a handshake, transferring the virus. Airborne transmission happens when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets containing the virus into the air, which can then be inhaled by others. Surface contamination involves the virus landing on surfaces, where it can survive for several hours. When someone touches these contaminated surfaces and then touches their face, particularly the nose or mouth, they can become infected. To reduce the spread of cold germs, it is important to practice good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water, use hand sanitizers, cover the mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, and regularly disinfect commonly touched surfaces."

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.

Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\nAnswer: Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can an abscessed tooth cause a heart attack?\nAnswer: 1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Some preliminary research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for fibromyalgia symptoms has had promising results.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes rib cage pain? How is it remedied?\nAnswer: Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following: Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis) Osteoporosis Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply) Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Osteoporosis and Calcium's Role**: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium is a crucial mineral for bone health, and adequate calcium intake is essential for maintaining bone density and strength. Calcium supplements are often recommended for individuals with osteoporosis, especially if dietary intake is insufficient.\n\n2. **Role of Magnesium in Bone Health**: Magnesium is another important mineral that plays a role in bone health. It is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone formation and resorption, respectively. Magnesium also helps regulate calcium levels in the body.\n\n3. **Synergistic Effects of Calcium and Magnesium**: There is evidence suggesting that magnesium can enhance the benefits of calcium for bone health. Magnesium deficiency can impair calcium metabolism and bone formation, so ensuring adequate magnesium intake is important for individuals taking calcium supplements for osteoporosis.\n\n4. **Recommended Dosages and Balance**: It is important to maintain a proper balance between calcium and magnesium intake. Excessive calcium without adequate magnesium can lead to imbalances and potential health issues, such as kidney stones or cardiovascular problems. The recommended daily intake for calcium is about 1,000-1,200 mg for adults, while for magnesium, it is about 310-420 mg, depending on age and sex.\n\n5. **Consultation with Healthcare Provider**: Individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen. This is to ensure that the supplements are necessary and to determine the appropriate dosages based on individual health needs and conditions.\n\nFinal answer: Calcium supplements can be beneficial for individuals with osteoporosis, as calcium is essential for maintaining bone density and strength. The addition of magnesium can indeed provide greater benefits, as magnesium plays a crucial role in bone health and helps regulate calcium levels in the body. Ensuring an adequate intake of both minerals can enhance bone formation and prevent deficiencies that could impair bone health. However, it is important to maintain a proper balance between calcium and magnesium intake to avoid potential health issues. Individuals should consult with their healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosages and ensure that the supplements are necessary based on their specific health needs."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1.

This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk.

The syndrome is named after the doctors who first described it, Dr. John Beckwith and Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann.\n\n1. **Characteristics**: Individuals with BWS often present with a variety of physical features and symptoms, including:\n   - Macrosomia (above-average birth weight and length)\n   - Macroglossia (enlarged tongue)\n   - Omphalocele (an abdominal wall defect where organs protrude outside the body)\n   - Hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth of one side of the body)\n   - Ear creases or pits\n   - Neonatal hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels in newborns)\n   - Increased risk of developing embryonal tumors, such as Wilms tumor (a kidney cancer) and hepatoblastoma (a liver cancer).\n\n2. **Genetic Basis**: BWS is primarily caused by abnormalities in the regulation of genes on chromosome 11p15.5. This region contains several genes that are involved in growth regulation, including IGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) and CDKN1C (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1C). The condition can result from various genetic mechanisms, including:\n   - Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11\n   - Mutations or deletions in the CDKN1C gene\n   - Abnormal methylation patterns at imprinting control regions (ICRs) on chromosome 11p15.5.\n\n3. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis of BWS is based on clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Key diagnostic criteria include the presence of characteristic physical features and a positive family history. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis by identifying abnormalities in the 11p15.5 region. Techniques used for genetic testing include:\n   - Methylation analysis\n   - Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA)\n   - DNA sequencing.\n\n4. **Management and Treatment**: Management of BWS involves a multidisciplinary approach to address the various symptoms and complications. Key aspects of management include:\n   - Regular monitoring for tumor development through abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels.\n   - Surgical intervention for structural anomalies such as omphalocele and macroglossia.\n   - Management of neonatal hypoglycemia through frequent feeding and glucose monitoring.\n   - Orthopedic evaluation and intervention for hemihyperplasia.\n\n5. **Prognosis and Complications**: The prognosis for individuals with BWS varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of complications. Early detection and management of tumors are crucial for improving outcomes. Most children with BWS lead relatively normal lives with appropriate medical care, although they may require ongoing monitoring for potential complications.\n\nIn summary, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is a complex genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors. It is caused by abnormalities in the regulation of genes on chromosome 11p15.5. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation and genetic testing, and management requires a multidisciplinary approach to address the various symptoms and complications associated with the condition."

            "free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.",

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can electrical high voltage shock cause swallowing difficulty?\n\nAnswer:  An electrical injury is damage to the skin or internal organs when a person comes into direct contact with an electrical current. Symptoms may include: Changes in alertness (consciousness) Broken bones Heart attack (chest, arm, neck, jaw, or back pain) Headache Problems with swallowing, vision, or hearing Irregular heartbeat Muscle spasms and pain Numbness or tingling Breathing problems or lung failure Seizures Skin burns\n\t\t\t\t\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What medication should a 65 year old male use for leg pain?\nAnswer: Take over-the-counter pain medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. 2. Try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve)\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is fibromyalgia and how is it treated?\nAnswer: What do we know about the effectiveness of complementary health approaches for fibromyalgia? Although some studies of tai chi, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback for fibromyalgia have had promising results, the evidence is too limited to allow definite conclusions to be reached about whether these approaches are helpful. It's uncertain whether acupuncture is helpful for fibromyalgia pain. Vitamin D supplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in this vitamin. Some preliminary research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for fibromyalgia symptoms has had promising results.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is hepatitis and how is it transmitted?\nAnswer: Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E.

Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: oxytetracycline hydrochloride and neomycin sulfate powder (NEO-OXY 100/100)is used for the treatment of what conditions and in what subjects?\nAnswer: Calves (milk replacer): For Calves (up to 250 lb): For treatment of bacterial enteritis caused by Escheria coli susceptible to oxytetracycline; treatment and control of colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by Escheria coli susceptible by neomycin.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is the shingles virus contagious in the workplace, especially where food is being prepared?\nAnswer: Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What is hepatitis and how is it transmitted?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have \"tender points\" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: To what extent is quinine in seltzer water effective in treating leg cramps?\nAnswer: Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events, especially in overdosage.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer.

Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding an Abscessed Tooth**: An abscessed tooth is a localized infection within the tooth or gums, often caused by severe tooth decay, gum disease, or trauma to the tooth. The infection can lead to the formation of pus and swelling in the affected area.\n2. **Systemic Effects of Dental Infections**: Dental infections, if left untreated, can spread beyond the oral cavity. Bacteria from an abscessed tooth can enter the bloodstream, leading to a condition known as bacteremia.\n3. **Link Between Oral Health and Cardiovascular Health**: There is a well-documented association between poor oral health and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic inflammation and infections in the mouth can contribute to systemic inflammation, which is a risk factor for heart disease.\n4. **Mechanism of Potential Heart Attack**: If the bacteria from an abscessed tooth enter the bloodstream, they can potentially reach the heart and cause endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This condition can lead to serious complications, including heart attack, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.\n5. **Risk Factors and Vulnerable Populations**: Individuals with compromised immune systems, pre-existing heart conditions, or those who have undergone certain heart surgeries are at higher risk of developing complications from dental infections.\n\nFinal answer: An abscessed tooth can potentially lead to a heart attack, although this is a rare and severe complication. The primary concern is that the bacteria from the dental infection can enter the bloodstream, causing bacteremia. Once in the bloodstream, these bacteria can travel to the heart and cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart's inner lining. Endocarditis can lead to serious cardiovascular complications, including heart attack, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions or weakened immune systems.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\n\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction?\nAnswer: Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for indications for NSAID use.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems.

If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\nAnswer: Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: If a person is allergic to Penicillin, is he likely to be allergic to Cephalexin also?\n\nAnswer: Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\nAnswer: Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\nAnswer: Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\n\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases?\nAnswer: Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any specialty may encounter patients with autoimmune disease.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood.

Lung failure can occur and may lead to death. Even with aggressive treatment, more than one half of people who have this disease in their lungs die.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What, besides cipro, penicillin, and drugs containing dairy products, can my doctor prescribe for my bad UTI?\nAnswer: Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs: * The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious. * Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days. * Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low. * Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these drugs. * Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens. Antibiotic Regimen.

            "free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.",

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\nAnswer: Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures.

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases?\nAnswer: Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any specialty may encounter patients with autoimmune disease.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is hepatitis and how is it transmitted?\nAnswer: Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Can Lipnodes and/or Liver cancer be detected in an upper GI endoscopy?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1. [First key point or step in your reasoning]\n2. [Second key point or step]\n3. [Third key point or step]\n(Add more steps if necessary)\n\nFinal answer: [Your comprehensive answer based on the analysis above]\n\nEnsure your analysis is thorough and your final answer is detailed and directly addresses the question.",

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Upper GI Endoscopy**: An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to view the upper part of the digestive system, including the esophagus, stomach, and the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum). It involves the use of an endoscope, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached to it.\n\n2. **Detection Capabilities of Upper GI Endoscopy**: The primary purpose of an upper GI endoscopy is to diagnose and sometimes treat conditions affecting the upper GI tract, such as ulcers, inflammation, tumors, and bleeding. It is not typically used to examine lymph nodes (lipnodes) or the liver directly, as these structures are not part of the upper GI tract.\n\n3. **Lymph Nodes (Lipnodes) and Liver Cancer**: Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system and are located throughout the body, including areas near the GI tract. Liver cancer involves the liver, which is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen but is not directly visualized during an upper GI endoscopy.\n\n4. **Alternative Diagnostic Methods**: To detect abnormalities in lymph nodes or liver cancer, other imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) scans are typically used. These methods provide a more comprehensive view of the liver and surrounding structures.\n\nFinal answer: An upper GI endoscopy is not designed to detect lymph nodes (lipnodes) or liver cancer directly. This procedure is focused on examining the esophagus, stomach, and the beginning of the small intestine. To detect lymph node abnormalities or liver cancer, other imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, or PET scans are more appropriate.

The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is aclidinium a steroid? Is it contraindicated within 12 months prior to cataract surgery?\nAnswer: 1. Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\nAnswer: Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose. Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Lipitor (Atorvastatin)**: Lipitor is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver.\n2. **Potential Side Effects**: While generally well-tolerated, statins, including Lipitor, can have side effects, one of which is hepatotoxicity (liver damage). This is why liver function monitoring is often recommended.\n3. **Guidelines and Recommendations**: Clinical guidelines from various health organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), provide recommendations on the monitoring of liver function in patients taking statins.\n4. **Frequency of Monitoring**: The guidelines typically suggest baseline liver function tests before starting statin therapy. Routine periodic monitoring is not universally recommended unless there are specific indications such as symptoms of liver dysfunction or other risk factors.\n5. **Individual Risk Factors**: Patients with pre-existing liver conditions, those who consume significant amounts of alcohol, or those who are on multiple medications that affect the liver may require more frequent monitoring.\n\nFinal answer: It is generally recommended to perform liver function tests before initiating Lipitor (atorvastatin) therapy to establish a baseline. Routine periodic monitoring of liver function every six months is not universally required for all patients on Lipitor. However, it may be recommended for certain individuals based on their risk factors, such as pre-existing liver conditions, significant alcohol consumption, or concurrent use of other hepatotoxic medications.

Penicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic, while cephalexin is a cephalosporin. Both share a beta-lactam ring in their chemical structure, which is responsible for their antibacterial activity.\n2. **Cross-Reactivity**: Due to the structural similarity, there is a potential for cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. Historically, it was believed that there was a significant risk of cross-allergy between these two classes.\n3. **Recent Studies**: More recent studies suggest that the actual risk of cross-reactivity is lower than previously thought. The risk is estimated to be around 1-10%, with first-generation cephalosporins (like cephalexin) having a slightly higher risk compared to later generations.\n4. **Allergy Testing**: If there is a concern about a potential allergic reaction, allergy testing (such as skin testing) can be performed to assess the risk more accurately.\n5. **Clinical Considerations**: In clinical practice, the decision to prescribe cephalexin to a patient with a penicillin allergy should be based on the severity of the penicillin allergy. For example, if the patient had a mild rash, cephalexin might be considered with caution.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease?\nAnswer: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

Treatment and management depend on the stage of the disease.\n4. **Treatment Options**: The primary treatment for syphilis is antibiotics, with penicillin being the most effective. The dosage and duration of treatment vary depending on the stage of the disease.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment and to check for any complications or recurrence.\n6. **Precautions and Prevention**: Patients should be educated on safe sexual practices to prevent the spread of syphilis. Partners should also be informed and tested.\n\nFinal answer: \n\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. A positive VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test indicates the presence of antibodies produced in response to this infection. Here are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients:\n\n1. **Confirmatory Testing**: After a positive VDRL test, a confirmatory test such as the FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.\n\n2. **Treatment**:\n   - **Primary and Secondary Syphilis**: The standard treatment is an intramuscular injection of Benzathine penicillin G. For those allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics such as doxycycline or azithromycin may be used.\n   - **Latent Syphilis**: For early latent syphilis, a single dose of Benzathine penicillin G is usually sufficient. For late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration, three doses of Benzathine penicillin G at weekly intervals are recommended.\n   - **Tertiary Syphilis**: This stage may require more intensive treatment, often involving multiple doses of Benzathine penicillin G.\n   - **Neurosyphilis**: This form of syphilis requires intravenous penicillin G, administered every 4 hours for 10-14 days.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Patients should have regular follow-up appointments to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. Blood tests should be repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure the infection has been fully eradicated. If symptoms persist or recur, further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.\n\n4. **Precautions and Prevention**:\n   - **Safe Sexual Practices**: Patients should be educated on the importance of using condoms and having regular sexual health check-ups to prevent the spread of syphilis.\n   - **Partner Notification and Treatment**: Sexual partners should be informed, tested, and treated if necessary to prevent reinfection and further transmission.\n   - **Avoiding Sexual Activity**: Patients should abstain from sexual activity until they and their partners have completed treatment and follow-up testing confirms the infection has been cleared.\n\nBy following these treatments and precautions, VDRL positive patients can effectively manage syphilis and reduce the risk of complications and transmission."

Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious. Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days. Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these drugs. Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can I stop using the patch (menopausal hormone therapy) after only 4.5 months?\nAnswer: Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system applied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara system, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3- to 6-month intervals. \n\n\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Loperamide Use**: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal medication commonly used to manage chronic diarrhea by slowing down gut movement, which allows for more water absorption and firmer stools.\n2. **Patient's Current Regimen**: The patient is using Loperamide but stops periodically to have a bowel movement, which remains loose. This indicates that while Loperamide is effective to some extent, it may not be fully addressing the issue or the dosing may need adjustment.\n3. **Potential Causes of Loose Stools**: Chronic diarrhea can have various underlying causes, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infections, or malabsorption syndromes. The effectiveness of Loperamide can vary depending on the underlying cause.\n4. **Balancing Medication and Bowel Movements**: The goal is to find a balance where the patient can manage diarrhea without causing constipation or overly loose stools. This may involve adjusting the dose of Loperamide or exploring additional treatments.\n5. **Dietary and Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet plays a significant role in managing chronic diarrhea. Identifying and avoiding trigger foods, increasing fiber intake, and staying hydrated are important steps.\n6. **Consulting a Healthcare Provider**: It is crucial for the patient to work with their healthcare provider to adjust their treatment plan, which may include further diagnostic tests to identify the underlying cause of chronic diarrhea.\n\nFinal answer: To achieve a \"happy medium\" in managing chronic diarrhea with Loperamide, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Adjusting Loperamide Dosage**: Consult your healthcare provider to adjust the dosage of Loperamide. Sometimes, a lower or more frequent dosing schedule can help achieve better control over bowel movements without causing constipation.\n2. **Identifying Underlying Causes**: Work with your healthcare provider to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to chronic diarrhea. This may involve diagnostic tests such as stool analysis, blood tests, or imaging studies.\n3. **Dietary Adjustments**: Implement dietary changes to help manage symptoms. This may include:\n   - Increasing fiber intake to bulk up stools.\n   - Identifying and avoiding foods that trigger diarrhea (e.g., dairy, gluten, fatty foods, caffeine).\n   - Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially if diarrhea is frequent.\n4. **Probiotics and Supplements**: Consider using probiotics to help balance gut flora, which can sometimes improve symptoms of chronic diarrhea.\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep a symptom diary to track bowel movements, diet, and medication use. This can help you and your healthcare provider identify patterns and make necessary adjustments.\n6. **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is essential to monitor your condition and make any necessary changes to your treatment plan.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can work towards finding a balance that allows you to manage chronic diarrhea effectively while minimizing the occurrence of loose stools."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

This condition leads to severe intellectual disability and multiple physical abnormalities, including heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).\n\n1. **Progressive Nature**: Trisomy 13 is not typically considered a progressive condition. The abnormalities and symptoms associated with Patau syndrome are present from birth and do not generally worsen over time. However, the severity of symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals. Many infants with Trisomy 13 have life-threatening medical problems, and the condition is often associated with a high mortality rate within the first days or weeks of life. Those who survive may have significant developmental delays and health issues, but the condition itself does not progressively worsen.\n\n2. **Diagnosis**: Trisomy 13 can be diagnosed both prenatally and postnatally.\n   - **Prenatal Diagnosis**: During pregnancy, Trisomy 13 can be suspected based on findings from an ultrasound or abnormal results from prenatal screening tests. Definitive diagnosis is made through genetic testing methods such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, which involve analyzing the chromosomes of fetal cells.\n   - **Postnatal Diagnosis**: After birth, a diagnosis of Trisomy 13 is typically confirmed through a physical examination that identifies characteristic features of the syndrome. A blood sample can be taken to perform a karyotype analysis, which will reveal the presence of an extra chromosome 13.\n\nIn summary, Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) is a severe genetic disorder present from birth, characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disability. It is not progressive, meaning the symptoms do not worsen over time, but the condition is often associated with a high mortality rate in infancy. Diagnosis can be made prenatally through genetic testing or postnatally through physical examination and karyotype analysis."

Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.",

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose. Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can I stop using the patch (menopausal hormone therapy) after only 4.5 months?\nAnswer: Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system applied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara system, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3- to 6-month intervals. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is aclidinium a steroid?

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.

What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)**: KTS is a rare congenital condition characterized by a triad of port-wine stains (capillary malformations), venous malformations, and limb overgrowth. It is important to understand the genetic and pathophysiological basis of the syndrome.\n2. **Current Findings on Causation**: Recent research has focused on genetic mutations and molecular pathways involved in KTS. Identifying these can help in understanding the etiology and potential targets for therapy.\n3. **Current Treatment Approaches**: Treatment for KTS is multidisciplinary and often involves managing symptoms and complications. This includes medical, surgical, and interventional radiology approaches.\n4. **Therapies and Management Strategies**: Physical therapy, compression garments, and other supportive therapies play a crucial role in managing KTS. Newer therapies and clinical trials may offer additional insights.\n5. **Recent Advances and Research**: Keeping up with the latest research findings, clinical trials, and expert consensus guidelines is essential for providing the most current and effective care.\n\nFinal answer:\nKlippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a combination of port-wine stains (capillary malformations), venous malformations, and limb overgrowth. The exact cause of KTS is not fully understood, but recent studies have identified somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene as a significant contributor. These mutations lead to abnormal cell growth and vascular malformations, which are hallmarks of the syndrome.\n\n**Causation**:\nRecent genetic research has pinpointed somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene as a primary cause of KTS. These mutations result in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. The identification of these mutations has provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying KTS and has opened up potential avenues for targeted therapies.\n\n**Treatment**:\nThe treatment of KTS is multidisciplinary and tailored to the individual patient's symptoms and complications. Key components of treatment include:\n\n1. **Medical Management**: This involves the use of medications to manage pain, infections, and other symptoms. Anticoagulants may be prescribed to prevent blood clots in patients with significant venous malformations.\n\n2. **Surgical Interventions**: Surgery may be necessary to correct limb overgrowth, remove problematic vascular malformations, or address complications such as bleeding or ulceration. Procedures can include laser therapy for port-wine stains, sclerotherapy for venous malformations, and orthopedic surgeries for limb discrepancies.\n\n3. **Interventional Radiology**: Minimally invasive procedures such as embolization and sclerotherapy are often used to manage vascular malformations. These techniques can reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients with KTS.\n\n**Therapies and Management Strategies**:\n1. **Physical Therapy**: Regular physical therapy can help manage pain, improve mobility, and prevent complications related to limb overgrowth and venous malformations.\n\n2. **Compression Garments**: These are used to manage swelling and prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis. Custom-fitted compression garments can provide significant relief for patients with KTS.\n\n3. **Supportive Care**: This includes wound care for ulcerations, psychological support, and regular monitoring for complications such as infections or blood clots.\n\n**Recent Advances and Research**:\nOngoing research and clinical trials are exploring the use of targeted therapies that inhibit the PI3K-AKT pathway. These therapies hold promise for more effective management of KTS by directly addressing the underlying genetic mutations. Additionally, advancements in imaging techniques and interventional radiology are improving the precision and outcomes of treatments for vascular malformations.\n\nIn summary, Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to management. Recent genetic discoveries have enhanced our understanding of its causation, and ongoing research continues to improve treatment options and outcomes for affected children."

Treating plantar fasciitis may also involve the use of over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatories, orthotic shoe inserts which can help distribute pressure more equally across your foot, corticosteroid injections, and in severe cases, surgery. Resting and staying off your feet can also help alleviate some of the pain caused by plantar fasciitis.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Definition of Sleep Apnea**: Understanding what sleep apnea is, including its types and symptoms.\n2. **Common Treatments for Sleep Apnea**: Exploring the standard non-surgical treatments available for sleep apnea.\n3. **Surgical Options for Sleep Apnea**: Identifying the types of surgeries available for treating sleep apnea.\n4. **Effectiveness of Surgery**: Evaluating the success rates and potential risks or complications associated with surgical treatments for sleep apnea.\n5. **Considerations for Surgery**: Discussing when surgery might be considered over other treatments and the factors influencing this decision.\n\nFinal answer:\nSleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep. These interruptions, known as apneas, can last from a few seconds to minutes and may occur multiple times per hour. The two main types of sleep apnea are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is caused by a physical blockage of the airway, and central sleep apnea (CSA), which occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. Symptoms of sleep apnea include loud snoring, episodes of stopped breathing during sleep, abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking, morning headache, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and irritability.\n\nCommon treatments for sleep apnea typically start with non-surgical options. These include lifestyle changes such as weight loss, avoiding alcohol and sedatives, and sleeping on one's side. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most common and effective treatment for OSA, where a machine delivers air pressure through a mask to keep the airway open during sleep. Other options include oral appliances designed to keep the throat open and positional therapy to prevent back-sleeping.\n\nWhen non-surgical treatments are ineffective or not tolerated, surgical options may be considered. Surgical treatments for sleep apnea include:\n\n1. **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**: Removal of excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway.\n2. **Genioglossus Advancement (GA)**: Repositioning of the tongue muscle attachment to prevent airway collapse.\n3. **Maxillomandibular Advancement (MMA)**: Repositioning of the upper and lower jaw to enlarge the airway space.\n4. **Radiofrequency Volumetric Tissue Reduction (RFVTR)**: Using radiofrequency energy to shrink tissues in the airway.\n5. **Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation**: Implanting a device that stimulates the nerve controlling tongue movements to keep the airway open.\n\nThe effectiveness of surgery in treating sleep apnea varies depending on the type of surgery and the individual patient. Success rates for UPPP, for example, range from 40% to 60%, while MMA has higher success rates, often exceeding 80%. However, surgical treatments carry risks such as infection, bleeding, and changes in voice or swallowing. Additionally, some patients may still require CPAP therapy post-surgery.\n\nSurgery is typically considered when patients have moderate to severe OSA and have not responded to or cannot tolerate CPAP therapy or other non-surgical treatments. Factors influencing the decision to opt for surgery include the patient's anatomy, overall health, severity of sleep apnea, and personal preference.\n\nIn summary, sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder with various treatment options. Surgery can be effective, particularly for patients who do not respond to non-surgical treatments, but it comes with risks and varying success rates. A thorough evaluation by a sleep specialist is essential to determine the most appropriate treatment plan."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can electrical high voltage shock cause swallowing difficulty?\n\nAnswer:  An electrical injury is damage to the skin or internal organs when a person comes into direct contact with an electrical current. Symptoms may include: Changes in alertness (consciousness) Broken bones Heart attack (chest, arm, neck, jaw, or back pain) Headache Problems with swallowing, vision, or hearing Irregular heartbeat Muscle spasms and pain Numbness or tingling Breathing problems or lung failure Seizures Skin burns\n\t\t\t\t\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Are confusion and facial itch possible side effects of methadone?\nAnswer: The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.\nAnswer: prospective monitoring of serum enzymes upon initiating atorvastatin therapy is no longer recommended. Clinically apparent liver injury attributed to atorvastatin is usually self-limited and recovery is complete within 1 to 4 months.  \n\n\nLive QA Question: Define Syncope (ischemic stroke)?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Syncope**: Syncope is a medical term for fainting or a temporary loss of consciousness usually related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. It is not a disease itself but a symptom of various conditions.\n2. **Understanding Ischemic Stroke**: An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed, leading to a reduction in blood flow and oxygen to a part of the brain, causing brain cells to die.\n3. **Differentiating Syncope and Ischemic Stroke**: Syncope and ischemic stroke are distinct medical conditions with different underlying mechanisms. Syncope is generally transient and reversible, while an ischemic stroke can cause permanent brain damage.\n4. **Possible Confusion**: The question seems to conflate syncope with ischemic stroke, which are separate entities. However, syncope can sometimes be a symptom or a precursor to more serious conditions, including strokes, but they are not synonymous.\n\nFinal answer: Syncope, commonly known as fainting, is a temporary loss of consciousness due to a sudden decrease in blood flow to the brain. It is often caused by factors such as dehydration, low blood pressure, or sudden changes in posture. On the other hand, an ischemic stroke is a serious medical condition where a blood clot obstructs a blood vessel in the brain, leading to a reduction in blood flow and oxygen to brain tissue, causing cell death and potentially permanent damage.\n\nWhile syncope and ischemic stroke are distinct conditions, it is important to note that syncope can sometimes be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition, including cardiovascular issues that might increase the risk of stroke. However, syncope itself is not synonymous with an ischemic stroke. If someone experiences syncope, especially if it is recurrent or associated with other symptoms like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, they should seek medical evaluation to rule out serious conditions, including the possibility of a stroke."

This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

This condition typically causes stabbing pain in the heel, which is often worse with the first steps in the morning or after long periods of standing or sitting.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**:\nPlantar fasciitis is often caused by repetitive strain injury to the plantar fascia ligament. This can result from excessive walking, running, or standing, especially on hard surfaces. Risk factors include:\n- Age: Most common between ages 40 and 60.\n- Certain types of exercise: Activities that place a lot of stress on your heel and attached tissue, such as long-distance running, ballet dancing, and aerobic dance.\n- Foot mechanics: Flat feet, a high arch, or even an abnormal pattern of walking can affect the way weight is distributed when you're standing and can put added stress on the plantar fascia.\n- Obesity: Excess weight puts extra stress on your plantar fascia.\n- Occupations that keep you on your feet: Factory workers, teachers, and others who spend most of their work hours walking or standing on hard surfaces.\n\n**Diagnosis**:\nDiagnosis is typically based on medical history and physical examination. Your doctor may check for areas of tenderness in your foot. The location of your pain can help determine its cause. Imaging tests such as X-rays or MRI may be used to rule out other conditions.\n\n**Treatment Options**:\nTreatment for plantar fasciitis usually begins with conservative methods:\n- **Rest and Activity Modification**: Reducing or modifying activities that cause pain.\n- **Ice**: Applying ice to the painful area can help reduce inflammation.\n- **Stretching and Strengthening Exercises**: Exercises to stretch the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon and to strengthen lower leg muscles.\n- **Footwear and Orthotics**: Wearing supportive shoes and using orthotic devices to distribute pressure more evenly.\n- **Medications**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n- **Physical Therapy**: A physical therapist can provide additional treatments and exercises to help manage symptoms.\n- **Night Splints**: Wearing a splint that stretches your calf and the arch of your foot while you sleep.\n\nIf conservative treatments are not effective, more advanced options may be considered:\n- **Corticosteroid Injections**: Injections of a type of steroid medication can provide temporary pain relief.\n- **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy**: This treatment uses sound waves to stimulate healing in the plantar fascia.\n- **Surgery**: In rare cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to detach the plantar fascia from the heel bone.\n\n**Prevention and Management**:\nTo prevent plantar fasciitis or manage symptoms long-term, consider the following:\n- Maintain a healthy weight to minimize stress on your feet.\n- Choose supportive shoes with good arch support and cushioning.\n- Avoid walking barefoot on hard surfaces.\n- Incorporate stretching exercises into your daily routine, especially before and after exercise.\n- Gradually increase the intensity of any new physical activities.\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for plantar fasciitis, individuals can take proactive steps to manage and alleviate this painful condition."

Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can an abscessed tooth cause a heart attack?\nAnswer: 1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Definition and Classification**: Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid medication. It is important to define what methylprednisolone is and classify it within the broader category of corticosteroids.\n2. **Mechanism of Action**: Understanding how methylprednisolone works in the body is crucial. This involves explaining its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.\n3. **Uses and Indications**: Highlight the various medical conditions for which methylprednisolone is prescribed, such as autoimmune diseases, allergic reactions, and inflammatory conditions.\n4. **Administration and Dosage**: Discuss the common forms in which methylprednisolone is administered (e.g., oral, intravenous) and typical dosages.\n5. **Side Effects and Risks**: Detail the potential side effects and risks associated with methylprednisolone use, including both short-term and long-term effects.\n6. **Contraindications and Precautions**: Mention any conditions or situations where methylprednisolone should be used with caution or avoided altogether.\n\nFinal answer: Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid medication that is used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It works by mimicking the effects of hormones your body produces naturally in your adrenal glands. Methylprednisolone decreases inflammation by inhibiting the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation and by suppressing the immune system, which can be beneficial in treating autoimmune conditions.\n\nMethylprednisolone is commonly prescribed for a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, severe allergic reactions, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is also used in the treatment of certain types of cancer and to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.\n\nThe medication can be administered in several forms, including oral tablets, intravenous (IV) injections, and intramuscular (IM) injections. The dosage and duration of treatment with methylprednisolone depend on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response to the medication.\n\nWhile methylprednisolone is effective in managing inflammation and immune responses, it can have several side effects. Common short-term side effects include increased appetite, weight gain, insomnia, and mood changes. Long-term use of methylprednisolone can lead to more serious side effects such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, increased risk of infections, and thinning of the skin.\n\nCertain conditions may contraindicate the use of methylprednisolone, such as active infections, certain types of fungal infections, and known hypersensitivity to the drug. It is important to use this medication under the supervision of a healthcare provider, who will monitor for potential side effects and adjust the dosage as necessary.\n\nIn summary, methylprednisolone is a powerful corticosteroid used to treat a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system but comes with potential side effects that require careful management and monitoring."

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it?\nAnswer: Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: If a person is allergic to Penicillin, is he likely to be allergic to Cephalexin also?\n\nAnswer: Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.\nAnswer: prospective monitoring of serum enzymes upon initiating atorvastatin therapy is no longer recommended. Clinically apparent liver injury attributed to atorvastatin is usually self-limited and recovery is complete within 1 to 4 months.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Is aclidinium a steroid? Is it contraindicated within 12 months prior to cataract surgery?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1. [First key point or step in your reasoning]\n2. [Second key point or step]\n3. [Third key point or step]\n(Add more steps if necessary)\n\nFinal answer: [Your comprehensive answer based on the analysis above]\n\nEnsure your analysis is thorough and your final answer is detailed and directly addresses the question.",

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Aclidinium**: Aclidinium is a medication used primarily for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is classified as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), not a steroid.\n2. **Steroid Classification**: Steroids, particularly corticosteroids, are a different class of medications used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Aclidinium does not fall under this category.\n3. **Cataract Surgery Considerations**: When considering medications in the context of cataract surgery, it is important to understand potential contraindications and interactions. Steroids can be relevant in this context because they can increase the risk of cataract formation or exacerbate existing cataracts.\n4. **Aclidinium and Cataract Surgery**: There is no established contraindication for the use of aclidinium within 12 months prior to cataract surgery. The primary concerns with cataract surgery typically involve medications that affect bleeding risk, intraocular pressure, or wound healing, none of which are directly impacted by aclidinium.\n\nFinal answer: Aclidinium is not a steroid; it is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no contraindication for using aclidinium within 12 months prior to cataract surgery. The primary concerns for medications in the context of cataract surgery usually involve those that affect bleeding risk, intraocular pressure, or wound healing, which are not issues associated with aclidinium. Therefore, aclidinium can be safely used without specific concerns related to cataract surgery."

Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: If a person is allergic to Penicillin, is he likely to be allergic to Cephalexin also?\n\nAnswer: Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\n\nLive QA Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Non-Aspirin NSAIDs**: Non-aspirin NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) are a class of medications commonly used to reduce inflammation, pain, and fever. Examples include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac.\n2. **Reviewing the Link to Erectile Dysfunction (ED)**: Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Various factors, including medications, can contribute to ED.\n3. **Examining Research and Studies**: Investigate the scientific literature and clinical studies to determine if there is a documented association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and erectile dysfunction.\n4. **Historical Context**: Determine when the first studies or reports linking non-aspirin NSAIDs to ED were published to understand the timeline of this association.\n5. **Mechanisms of Action**: Consider the biological mechanisms by which non-aspirin NSAIDs might contribute to erectile dysfunction, such as effects on blood flow, hormonal balance, or psychological factors.\n\nFinal answer: Non-aspirin NSAIDs have been implicated in erectile dysfunction through various studies and clinical observations. The association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and erectile dysfunction was first suggested in research published in the early 2000s. For example, a study published in the \"Journal of Urology\" in 2005 found that regular use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that NSAIDs may affect blood flow and vascular function, which are critical for achieving and maintaining an erection. Additionally, NSAIDs can influence hormonal pathways and potentially lead to psychological stress, both of which can contribute to erectile dysfunction. Therefore, while the link has been recognized for nearly two decades, ongoing research continues to explore the extent and mechanisms of this association. If you are experiencing erectile dysfunction and are taking non-aspirin NSAIDs, it is advisable to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss potential alternatives or additional treatments."
