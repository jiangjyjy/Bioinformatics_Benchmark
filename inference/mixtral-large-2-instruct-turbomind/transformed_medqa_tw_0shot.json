            " Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Disease and Surgery**: The question mentions medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or C-cell carcinoma, which is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland. The patient has undergone a total thyroidectomy, which is the surgical removal of the entire thyroid gland.\n\n2. **Purpose of Detection**: The goal is to detect recurrence or metastasis of medullary thyroid carcinoma after surgery.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A: CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)**: CEA is a nonspecific tumor marker that can be elevated in various types of cancer, including medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, it is not specific to MTC and can be elevated in other conditions as well.\n   - **B: Calcitonin**: Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the C cells of the thyroid gland. It is a highly specific and sensitive marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Elevated calcitonin levels post-thyroidectomy strongly suggest recurrence or metastasis of MTC.\n   - **C: Thyroglobulin**: Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It is a marker for differentiated thyroid cancers (papillary and follicular), not medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n   - **D: TSH-receptor Ab (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Receptor Antibody)**: This is associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases like Graves' disease, not with medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the specificity and sensitivity of the markers for medullary thyroid carcinoma, calcitonin is the most appropriate choice for detecting recurrence or metastasis after total thyroidectomy.\n\nFinal answer: B: 抑鈣素（calcitonin）"

            " Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a large staghorn kidney stone (struvite stone, composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate) and acute pyelonephritis. Staghorn stones are large and branched, filling the renal pelvis and extending into the renal calyces. They are often associated with urinary tract infections and can lead to serious complications like sepsis if not treated.\n\n2. **Complications and Risks**: Acute pyelonephritis is a severe infection of the kidney that can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition. The presence of a staghorn stone can exacerbate the infection by obstructing urine flow and providing a nidus for bacterial growth. Without treatment, the infection can spread rapidly, leading to septic shock and organ failure.\n\n3. **Mortality Rates**: The mortality rate for untreated acute pyelonephritis with obstructive uropathy (such as that caused by a staghorn stone) is high. Sepsis resulting from untreated pyelonephritis has a mortality rate that can exceed 50%. Given the severity of the condition and the presence of an obstructive stone, the mortality risk is significantly elevated.\n\nFinal answer: D: 50%至 70%"

The symptoms include diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death if left untreated. The question describes a middle-aged man with symptoms of diarrhea, skin inflammation, and mental confusion, which are consistent with pellagra.\n\n2. **Niacin Deficiency**: The disease is primarily caused by a lack of niacin in the diet. Niacin is essential for the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated form (NADP), which are crucial coenzymes in various metabolic pathways. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n3. **Synthesis of NAD+**: NAD+ is synthesized from niacin or tryptophan, not the other way around. Thus, option B is incorrect because it suggests that NAD+ synthesizes niacin, which is not true.\n\n4. **Dietary Sources**: Pellagra is often associated with diets high in corn (maize) because niacin in corn is bound and not readily absorbed. However, traditional processing methods like nixtamalization can make niacin more bioavailable. Therefore, option C is incorrect as it suggests that people who consume corn as a staple food do not get pellagra, which is misleading without considering the preparation methods.\n\n5. **Neurological Impact**: Pellagra affects the nervous system, leading to symptoms like mental confusion and dementia.

These receptors are crucial for sensing the presence of feces or gas and initiating the appropriate response.\n\n2. **Anorectal Sensory Receptors**: Anorectal sensory receptors are responsible for detecting rectal distension, which is the stretching of the rectal walls. This sensation is important for the urge to defecate or pass gas.\n\n3. **Location of Sensory Receptors**: In the rectum, sensory receptors are primarily located in the mucosa and submucosa layers. The mucosa layer is the innermost layer that comes into direct contact with the contents of the rectum, while the submucosa layer lies just beneath the mucosa and contains a rich network of nerves and blood vessels.\n\n4. **Eliminating Options**:\n   - **C: 肌肉層 (Muscle Layer)**: The muscle layer is primarily responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the rectum but does not contain the sensory receptors for detecting rectal distension.\n   - **D: 漿膜層 (Serosa Layer)**: The serosa layer is the outermost layer of the rectum and does not contain sensory receptors related to defecation and gas expulsion.\n\n5. **Final Consideration**: Between the mucosa and submucosa layers, the mucosa layer is more directly involved in sensing the contents of the rectum due to its direct contact with feces and gas.\n\nFinal answer: A: 黏膜層 (Mucosa Layer)"

            " Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Disease**: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition characterized by the development of numerous polyps in the colon and rectum. These polyps have a high likelihood of becoming malignant if not treated.\n\n2. **Genetic Basis of FAP**: FAP is primarily caused by mutations in a specific gene. The most well-known and commonly associated gene with FAP is the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene.\n\n3. **Role of APC Gene**: The APC gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and division. Mutations in the APC gene lead to the formation of polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n4. **β-catenin Pathway**: The APC gene is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, where it helps regulate the levels of β-catenin. Mutations in APC can lead to abnormal accumulation of β-catenin, which contributes to the development of polyps.\n\n5. **Other Genes**: While the RB gene, p53 gene, and TGF-β receptor are also important in cancer development, they are not as directly linked to FAP as the APC gene.\n\nFinal answer: A: APC/β-catenin"
