Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does one taper off the drug Amlodipine and start Atenolol to avoid adverse side effects?\nAnswer: Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks. Do not abruptly discontinue without physician's advice.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Define Syncope (ischemic stroke)?\nAnswer: 1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Are confusion and facial itch possible side effects of methadone?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1.

Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for a complete evaluation and to learn what treatment may be best for you. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1.

Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is the shingles virus contagious in the workplace, especially where food is being prepared?\nAnswer: Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What are the most common ways of spreading cold germs?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. Cold germs, also known as viruses that cause the common cold, can be spread through various means. One of the primary ways is through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets contain the virus and can land on the mucous membranes of a nearby person's mouth, nose, or eyes, leading to infection.\n2. Touching contaminated surfaces is another common way of spreading cold germs. When an infected person touches surfaces such as doorknobs, keyboards, or phones, they can leave behind the virus on those surfaces. A healthy person who later touches the same surface and then touches their face, particularly their mouth, nose, or eyes, can become infected.\n3. Close personal contact, such as shaking hands, hugging, or sharing personal items like eating utensils, drinks, or towels, can also facilitate the spread of cold germs.\n\nFinal answer: The most common ways of spreading cold germs include the transmission of respiratory droplets through coughing, sneezing, or talking, touching contaminated surfaces, and close personal contact such as shaking hands, hugging, or sharing personal items. These methods allow the virus to spread from infected individuals to healthy ones, either through direct contact or by contaminating surfaces that others touch."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\nAnswer: Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can an abscessed tooth cause a heart attack?\nAnswer: 1.

Although some studies of tai chi, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback for fibromyalgia have had promising results, the evidence is too limited to allow definite conclusions to be reached about whether these approaches are helpful. It's uncertain whether acupuncture is helpful for fibromyalgia pain. Vitamin D supplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in this vitamin. Some preliminary research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for fibromyalgia symptoms has had promising results.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes rib cage pain?

Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\n\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs: * The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious. * Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days. * Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low. * Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these drugs. * Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens. Antibiotic Regimen.

Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration.

            "Analysis:\n1. Simvastatin is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. It belongs to the statin class of drugs, which works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver.\n2. The biological activity of simvastatin is related to the circadian rhythm of cholesterol synthesis, which peaks during the night. By inhibiting the enzyme, simvastatin suppresses the nighttime peak of cholesterol synthesis, leading to a greater reduction in cholesterol levels.\n3. The half-life of simvastatin is approximately 3 hours, meaning it takes about 3 hours for the body to eliminate half of the drug. Taking the medication in the evening allows it to reach its peak concentration during the night when cholesterol synthesis is at its highest, optimizing its therapeutic effect.\n\nFinal answer: Simvastatin should be taken in the evening rather than the morning because its activity is closely related to the circadian rhythm of cholesterol synthesis, which peaks at night. Taking the medication in the evening ensures it reaches its peak concentration during the night, optimizing its ability to lower cholesterol levels."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\nAnswer: Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal?\nAnswer: Hantavirus is a serious infection that gets worse quickly.

            "Analysis:\n1. First, it is essential to understand what Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is, including its causes, symptoms, and associated complications.\n2. Second, discuss the diagnosis process of BWS, including prenatal and postnatal methods.\n3. Third, address the available treatments and management strategies for individuals with BWS.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nBeckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a congenital overgrowth disorder characterized by abnormal growth and development. It is one of the most common overgrowth syndromes, affecting approximately 1 in 12,000 to 1 in 15,000 newborns. The primary features of BWS include large body size (macrosomia), hemihypertrophy (asymmetric overgrowth of one side of the body), macrocephaly (large head size), organomegaly (enlarged organs), and various other developmental abnormalities. These features can vary significantly among affected individuals.\n\nThe exact cause of BWS is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to abnormalities in the regulation of genes in the imprinted region on chromosome 11. Imprinting is a process where certain genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. In the case of BWS, the loss or alteration of maternal gene expression leads to the overgrowth phenotype. Genetic mutations, as well as epigenetic changes, have been implicated in the development of BWS.\n\nDiagnosis of BWS can be challenging, as the symptoms can be subtle and overlap with other conditions. Prenatal diagnosis may be considered when there is a family history of BWS or when ultrasound findings suggest the possibility of the syndrome. Prenatal testing includes detailed ultrasound examinations, molecular genetic testing for specific gene mutations, and assessment of the methylation status of the imprinted region on chromosome 11. Postnatal diagnosis is typically based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing.\n\nManagement of BWS involves a multidisciplinary approach, addressing the various medical, developmental, and social issues associated with the syndrome. Treatment may include monitoring and managing associated complications such as congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux, and breathing problems. Early intervention services, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, can help address developmental delays and other issues. In some cases, growth-promoting medications may be considered, but their use is limited due to potential side effects and the lack of long-term data.\n\nIn summary, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is a complex overgrowth disorder with a wide range of symptoms and complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can help improve the quality of life for individuals with BWS. However, there is currently no cure for the condition, and ongoing research is essential to better understand its causes and develop more effective treatments."

            "free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose. Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: oxytetracycline hydrochloride and neomycin sulfate powder (NEO-OXY 100/100)is used for the treatment of what conditions and in what subjects?\nAnswer: Calves (milk replacer): For Calves (up to 250 lb): For treatment of bacterial enteritis caused by Escheria coli susceptible to oxytetracycline; treatment and control of colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by Escheria coli susceptible by neomycin. Feed continuously for 7-14 days in milk replacer or starter feed. Treatment should continue 24 to 48 hours beyond remission of disease symptoms.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is the shingles virus contagious in the workplace, especially where food is being prepared?\nAnswer: Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1.

Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women.

Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. The blockage can cause damage to the heart muscle and lead to serious health consequences if not promptly treated.\n\nFinal answer: While an abscessed tooth itself cannot directly cause a heart attack, the infection from an abscessed tooth can enter the bloodstream and potentially contribute to a heart attack indirectly. In rare cases, the bacteria from an abscessed tooth could cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart's inner lining, which could lead to a heart attack-like situation. However, it is essential to note that this is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, and the risk of an abscessed tooth leading to a heart attack is low.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?\nAnswer: Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\n\nLive QA Question: The questioner is seeking information on a condition that affects children and is called Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

            "Analysis:\n1. First, it is essential to understand what Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is, including its symptoms, causes, and typical age of onset.\n2. Second, discuss the diagnosis process for ODD, including the criteria used by mental health professionals to identify the condition.\n3. Third, address the available treatments and management strategies for children with ODD, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach that includes therapy, medication, and parental involvement.\n\nFinal answer:\nOppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a childhood disorder characterized by a pattern of angry or disruptive behaviors that interfere with the child's normal functioning at home, school, or in other settings. It typically begins in the preschool or early childhood years, although it can persist into adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms of ODD include frequent temper tantrums, arguing with adults, deliberately annoying others, and defying rules or requests from adults. The exact cause of ODD is not known, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors.\n\nDiagnosing ODD involves a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional, including a thorough medical history, observation of the child's behavior, and interviews with parents, teachers, and other caregivers. The professional will use criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to determine if the child meets the diagnostic criteria for ODD, which includes a pattern of at least four of the eight listed symptoms present for at least six months, causing significant impairment in functioning, and not better explained by another mental disorder.\n\nTreatment for ODD typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, parent training, and, in some cases, medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help children learn to manage their emotions and develop more positive ways to express their feelings. Parent management training (PMT) teaches parents strategies to encourage positive behavior and discourage negative behavior in their children. In some cases, medications such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics may be prescribed to help manage symptoms, particularly when ODD is accompanied by other psychiatric conditions like ADHD or depression.\n\nParental involvement is crucial in the management of ODD, as consistent discipline, clear communication, and positive reinforcement can help support the child's progress in therapy and improve overall functioning. It is also important for parents to be aware of the potential impact of ODD on the family and to seek support for themselves and other family members as needed.\n\nIn summary, Oppositional Defiant Disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by disruptive behaviors that interfere with normal functioning. Early diagnosis and a comprehensive treatment approach involving therapy, medication, and parental involvement are essential for managing the condition and improving the child's quality of life."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

            "Analysis:\n1. First, it is essential to understand what Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is and its causes. DVT is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs, causing pain, swelling, and redness. It can be dangerous if the clot breaks off and travels to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for DVT include prolonged immobility, obesity, smoking, pregnancy, and use of estrogen-based medications such as birth control pills.\n\n2. Next, we need to examine the active ingredients and mechanism of action of Ocella. Ocella is an oral contraceptive that contains the combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel as its active ingredients. Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic version of estrogen, and levonorgestrel is a progestin. These hormones work together to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg, and changing the lining of the uterus to make it less receptive to a fertilized egg.\n\n3. We must now consider the relationship between estrogen-based birth control pills and the risk of DVT. Several studies have shown that the use of combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives, like Ocella, increases the risk of DVT compared to not using hormonal contraception. The risk is higher with certain progestin types and varying levels of estrogen, but even with the lowest doses of estrogen, there is still an increased risk compared to non-users.\n\nFinal answer: Yes, a birth control drug called Ocella can cause Deep Vein Thrombosis, as it contains estrogen and progestin, which have been associated with an increased risk of DVT. The risk may vary depending on the specific progestin and estrogen doses, but even with the lowest estrogen doses, there is still an elevated risk compared to non-users. It is essential for individuals considering using Ocella to discuss their personal risk factors and medical history with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision."

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases?\nAnswer: Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any specialty may encounter patients with autoimmune disease.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal?\nAnswer: Hantavirus is a serious infection that gets worse quickly. Lung failure can occur and may lead to death. Even with aggressive treatment, more than one half of people who have this disease in their lungs die.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What, besides cipro, penicillin, and drugs containing dairy products, can my doctor prescribe for my bad UTI?\nAnswer: Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs: * The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious. * Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days. * Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low. * Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these drugs. * Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens. Antibiotic Regimen.

            "free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.",

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is methylprednisolone and how does it affect the body?\nAnswer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood.

            "Analysis:\n1. An upper GI endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube with a camera (endoscope) through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine (duodenum) to visualize the lining of these organs and collect tissue samples if needed.\n2. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system, and they can be located in various parts of the body, including the neck, armpit, and groin. In the context of an upper GI endoscopy, the primary focus is on the upper digestive tract, and lymph nodes in this area may be assessed visually or through palpation if they are enlarged or abnormal.\n3. Liver cancer, on the other hand, is a more distant organ from the area typically examined during an upper GI endoscopy. However, an upper GI endoscopy may indirectly detect liver cancer if it has caused symptoms affecting the upper digestive tract, such as varices (enlarged blood vessels), bleeding, or obstruction.\n4. It is essential to note that an upper GI endoscopy is not the standard diagnostic tool for detecting lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) or liver cancer.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What, besides cipro, penicillin, and drugs containing dairy products, can my doctor prescribe for my bad UTI?\nAnswer: Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs: * The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious. * Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days. * Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low. * Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these drugs. * Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens. Antibiotic Regimen.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is aclidinium a steroid?

Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic, while cephalexin is a cephalosporin, which is a different group of antibiotics.\n2. Allergic reactions to antibiotics are specific to the class of antibiotic in many cases. An allergy to one antibiotic within a class does not necessarily mean an allergy to another antibiotic in a different class.\n3. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins can occur, but it is relatively low, especially between penicillin and the newer generations of cephalosporins, such as cephalexin (a first-generation cephalosporin).\n\nFinal answer: If a person is allergic to penicillin, they are not necessarily allergic to cephalexin. Although there can be some cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the risk of an allergic reaction to cephalexin is lower, especially since cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin.

Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: If a person is allergic to Penicillin, is he likely to be allergic to Cephalexin also?\n\nAnswer: Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What is fibromyalgia and how is it treated?\nAnswer: What do we know about the effectiveness of complementary health approaches for fibromyalgia? Although some studies of tai chi, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback for fibromyalgia have had promising results, the evidence is too limited to allow definite conclusions to be reached about whether these approaches are helpful. It's uncertain whether acupuncture is helpful for fibromyalgia pain. Vitamin D supplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in this vitamin.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease?\nAnswer: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.\nAnswer: The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?\nAnswer: 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

            "Analysis:\n1. First, it is essential to understand what quinine is and its known uses. Quinine is a medication used to treat or prevent malaria and to treat certain types of fever, such as malaria fever. It is also sometimes used to treat leg cramps due to its muscle-relaxing properties.\n2. Next, we need to consider the context of seltzer water. Seltzer water, also known as sparkling water, is a carbonated water. It does not inherently contain quinine unless it is added during the manufacturing process. Quinine-flavored seltzer water, often referred to as tonic water, is a common mixer in cocktails and can be consumed for its supposed benefits in treating leg cramps.\n3. Research the effectiveness of quinine in treating leg cramps. Some studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that quinine can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of leg cramps. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness.\n4. Consider the concentration of quinine in seltzer water. The amount of quinine in seltzer water can vary depending on the brand and product. Generally, quinine is added in smaller amounts to impart its distinctive taste, which may not be sufficient to effectively treat leg cramps.\n\n Final answer: Quinine in seltzer water may have some potential in treating leg cramps due to its muscle-relaxing properties, but the concentration of quinine in most seltzer waters is likely too low to be effective. Consuming quinine-flavored seltzer water, such as tonic water, may offer some benefit, but it is not a guaranteed solution for leg cramps.

        "origin_prompt": "You are a medical expert. Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?\nAnswer: 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.

            "Analysis:\n1. Trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13, which leads to a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. This additional genetic material disrupts the normal course of development and results in a range of physical and intellectual challenges.\n2. The diagnosis of trisomy 13 is typically made prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which involve analyzing the fetal cells to determine the presence of an extra chromosome 13. Postnatal diagnosis can be confirmed through a blood test called a karyotype, which examines the individual's chromosomes.\n3. Trisomy 13 is considered a progressive condition, as many of the associated health issues and developmental delays worsen over time. However, the rate and extent of progression can vary significantly among affected individuals.\n\nFinal answer: Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) is progressive, with the associated health issues and developmental delays typically worsening over time. The diagnosis is usually made prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, and can be confirmed postnatally through a karyotype."

            "free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.",

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea, stopping periodically to have a movement, which is loose. Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can I stop using the patch (menopausal hormone therapy) after only 4.5 months?\nAnswer: Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system applied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara system, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3- to 6-month intervals. \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is aclidinium a steroid?

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.\nAnswer: Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood. They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain. The treatment for Schmorl nodes typically focuses on managing symptoms, and it often involves physical therapy and pain relieving medications.In extreme cases where the Schmorl nodes are large or cause severe symptoms, surgical intervention could be considered, but this is rare.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can a birth control drug called Ocella cause Deep Vein Thrombosis?\nAnswer: Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects.

These episodes can last from a few seconds to minutes and may occur 30 times or more an hour.\n2. There are three main types of sleep apnea: obstructive, central, and mixed. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form, where the airway becomes blocked during sleep. Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. Mixed sleep apnea involves both types.\n3.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it harmful to use peroxide drops in the ear followed by a warm water flush to clean out ear wax?\nAnswer: To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax. Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Can electrical high voltage shock cause swallowing difficulty?\n\nAnswer:  An electrical injury is damage to the skin or internal organs when a person comes into direct contact with an electrical current.

Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.\nAnswer: prospective monitoring of serum enzymes upon initiating atorvastatin therapy is no longer recommended.

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?\nAnswer: Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.\n\n\nLive QA Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What causes Hypoglycemia in newborns and is there a way for a pregnant woman to avoid giving birth to a child with Hypoglycemia?\nAnswer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

Carefully analyze the following live QA question and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease?\nAnswer: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases?\nAnswer: Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any specialty may encounter patients with autoimmune disease.  \n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\nAnswer: 1.

Is there a way for a happy medium?\nAnswer: IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule Chronic Diarrhea Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration.

It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"\n\nExample:\nLive QA Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?\nAnswer: Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.\n\n\nLive QA Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction?\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1.
