The next step is to consider the protein RBM4, which is known to bind RNA sequences. RBM4 is a RNA binding protein found in Homo sapiens, and it is known to play a role in regulating gene expression.\n3. To predict whether the given RNA sequence can bind to RBM4, we need to consider the sequence motifs that are known to be recognized by RBM4. RBM4 is known to bind RNA sequences that contain a specific motif, known as the RRM (RNA recognition motif). This motif is typically found in the RNA sequences that are bound by RBM4.\n\nFinal answer: False. The given RNA sequence does not contain the RRM motif that is known to be recognized by RBM4, so it is unlikely to bind to this protein."
