Addressing the issue directly may help in identifying risk factors and providing necessary support.\n2. However, directly asking explicit questions may not always be effective, as some patients might not feel comfortable discussing sensitive topics, potentially leading to underreporting of symptoms.\n3.

This approach might encourage more honest communication, allowing for a better assessment of the risk.\n\nFinal answer: C: Address the issue indirectly so that the patient does not feel intimidated."

This means that any solid particles in the ointment must be controlled in size to prevent damage to the eye.\n2. Sterility is crucial for ophthalmological products, as the eye is a sensitive and vulnerable organ. Therefore, ophthalmological ointments must be sterile to prevent infections.\n3.

Pulmonary embolism (Option A) can present with similar symptoms, but the absence of any pulmonary auscultation findings and the patient's oxygen saturation while breathing room air argue against this diagnosis.\n3. An acute cerebrovascular accident of the posterior territory (Option B) might cause syncope, but the absence of focal neurological deficits and the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms make this less likely.\n4. Acute coronary syndrome (Option C) can cause syncope and dyspnea, but the absence of classic chest pain and the patient's overall clinical picture do not strongly support this diagnosis.\n5. Hypovolemic shock (Option D) can present with tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea, but the patient's oxygen saturation while breathing room air and the absence of other signs of volume depletion argue against this diagnosis.\n6. Acute pulmonary edema secondary to atrial flutter (Option E) can cause syncope, dizziness, and dyspnea, and the patient's tachycardia and hypotension could be consistent with this diagnosis.

This can have a significant impact on a child's or adolescent's psychosocial functioning, as they may struggle with forming and maintaining relationships, participating in school activities, and engaging in other age-appropriate social interactions. This suggests that children and adolescents with GSP may indeed present greater affectation in their psychosocial functioning compared to those with specific social phobia (SSP), who may only experience anxiety in certain social situations. This supports option A.\n\n2. Research has shown that the onset age for GSP is typically later than for SSP. While SSP can develop in early childhood, GSP is more likely to emerge during adolescence or early adulthood. This later onset age for GSP supports option B.\n\n3. Family history plays a significant role in the development of social phobia, and studies have found that children and adolescents with GSP are more likely to have a positive family history of social phobia compared to those with SSP.

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected by the disease.\n2. The index case is homozygous for the F508del mutation, meaning both parents must be carriers of the mutation (heterozygous).\n3. When two heterozygous carriers have children, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) and be affected by the disease, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier like the parents, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit no mutated genes and be unaffected.\n\nFinal answer: A: The probability that the next descendant is affected is 25%."

The liver also increases the production of ketone bodies, which are alternative energy sources derived from the breakdown of fatty acids. Ketone bodies can be used by the liver and other tissues, including the brain, to generate energy when glucose is scarce.\n3.
