The sequence is AGAGCGCGUCACGGUGGAUCUAGUUAGUACGAUCA. \nIf there is binding affinity, output true directly, otherwise output false directly.\nBinding Affinity: False\n\nExample:\nSequence: Predict with the given sequence if the RNA sequence can bind to the protein PUM in the species Drosophila melanogaster. The sequence is AGAACACGGGUAAUGUACAUAGGCCGAUGGCAAUCGCA. \nIf there is binding affinity, output true directly, otherwise output false directly.\nBinding Affinity: True\n\nExample:\nSequence: Predict with the given sequence if the RNA sequence can bind to the protein PUM in the species Drosophila melanogaster. The sequence is AGACCUGUCCAGUGGGAUCAAUAUGUACAUCAGAGCCA. \nIf there is binding affinity, output true directly, otherwise output false directly.\nBinding Affinity: True\n\nExample:\nSequence: Predict with the given sequence if the RNA sequence can bind to the protein PUM in the species Drosophila melanogaster. The sequence is AGGCGCAUAGGUGAACUUGUACAUUCUGGAAUCCCUUA. \nIf there is binding affinity, output true directly, otherwise output false directly.\nBinding Affinity: True\n\n\nSequence: Predict with the given sequence if the RNA sequence can bind to the protein PUM in the species Drosophila melanogaster. The sequence is AGAUAGUGAGAGCAGCAUUACACCAGUCCAGGCGAGUC. \nIf there is binding affinity, output true directly, otherwise output false directly.\n\nYour response should be structured as follows:\n\nAnalysis:\n1. [First key point or step in your reasoning]\n2. [Second key point or step]\n3. [Third key point or step]\n(Add more steps if necessary)\n\nBinding prediction (true/false): [Your prediction based on the analysis above]\n\nEnsure your analysis is thorough and your prediction is precise and directly addresses the sequence.",

            "Analysis:\n1. The given RNA sequence is AGAUAGUGAGAGCAGCAUUACACCAGUCCAGGCGAGUC.\n2. The sequence is 30 nucleotides long, which is within the typical binding range for proteins like PUM.\n3. The sequence contains a mix of purines (A, G) and pyrimidines (U, C), which could potentially form base pairs with the protein.\n4. The sequence does not contain any obvious secondary structures that would prevent it from binding to the protein.\n\nBinding prediction (true/false): True"
