It helps to protect neighboring cells by signaling them to produce antiviral proteins that inhibit viral replication.\n2. Interferon can also activate NK cells, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response by killing infected cells. Additionally, interferon can upregulate NK cell ligands on the surface of infected cells, making them more susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing.\n3. While the activation of the interferon response can lead to a decrease in viral replication within the cell, it is not directly responsible for initiating a rhinovirus-specific, cell-mediated immune response.

The patient's symptoms, such as hearing loud voices and paranoid thoughts, are indicative of a psychotic disorder, which is often associated with dopamine dysregulation.\n2. Among the dopaminergic pathways listed, the mesolimbic pathway is known to be involved in the reward system and is implicated in the positive symptoms of psychotic disorders, such as hallucinations and delusions.\n3. The mesocortical pathway, on the other hand, is associated with cognitive functions and is more closely related to the negative symptoms of psychotic disorders, such as social withdrawal and apathy.\n\nFinal answer: A: Mesolimbic pathway"

The tension in the biceps would increase as the motor units are recruited, starting with small motor units and progressing to larger ones as needed.\n2. In the second phase, the participant is doing 20 burpees, which is a high-intensity exercise that raises the heart rate to 150/min. This would primarily involve the cardiac muscle, which would increase its tension through an increase in the heart rate and stroke volume to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients.\n3. In the third phase, the gastrocnemius muscle is electrically stimulated with a frequency of 50 Hz. This would result in a fused tetanic contraction, where the muscle fibers contract continuously without relaxation, leading to an increase in tension.\n\nFinal answer: B (Increase of tension in experiments 2 and 3, with the same underlying mechanism) and D (Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments)."
