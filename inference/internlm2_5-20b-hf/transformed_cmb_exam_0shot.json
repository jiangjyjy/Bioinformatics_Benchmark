Fire is often associated with internal imbalances, such as emotional stress or pathogenic factors accumulating in the body, leading to heat generation. Heat, on the other hand, is typically associated with external factors, such as environmental heat or pathogenic heat invading the body.\n2. Fire tends to manifest in specific organs or tissues, often resulting from郁 (stagnation) or邪郁化火 (pathogenic factors accumulating and transforming into heat). Its nature is to ascend, affecting the upper parts of the body. Heat, in contrast, can affect the entire body, spreading through the meridians and affecting various organs and tissues.\n3. Fire has a greater tendency to consume blood and cause bleeding, as it can damage blood vessels and lead to hemorrhage. Heat, while also capable of consuming yin fluids, does not have the same propensity for causing bleeding as fire does.\n\nFinal answer: Fire is distinguished from heat by its origin (internal vs. external), manifestation (specific organs vs. whole body), and effects (tendency to consume blood and cause bleeding)."
