Secondly, implementing a consistent routine for feeding, especially before bedtime, can help. Paying attention to your baby's diet can also help, as some foods may cause gas and exacerbate symptoms in breastfed babies. It has been observed that babies who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to develop colic symptoms. Using a pacifier can often help a baby soothe themselves. If you're bottle feeding your baby, ensuring the baby is not swallowing air could reduce their discomfort.
