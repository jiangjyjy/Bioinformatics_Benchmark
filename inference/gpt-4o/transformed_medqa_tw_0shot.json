Both types generally have a good prognosis but require careful monitoring for recurrence or metastasis after treatment.\n\n2. **Post-surgical monitoring**: After a total thyroidectomy, it is crucial to monitor for any remaining thyroid tissue or cancer recurrence. This is typically done using specific biomarkers that are indicative of thyroid tissue presence or cancer activity.\n\n3. **Biomarker selection**:\n   - **CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)**: This is a marker often used in the monitoring of colorectal cancer and some other cancers, but it is not specific to thyroid cancer.\n   - **Calcitonin**: This hormone is produced by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid and is primarily used as a marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma, not papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma.\n   - **Thyroglobulin (Tg)**: This is a protein produced by normal thyroid tissue and differentiated thyroid cancer cells (including papillary and follicular types). After a total thyroidectomy, thyroglobulin levels should be very low or undetectable. Detectable or rising levels of thyroglobulin can indicate the presence of residual thyroid tissue or recurrence/metastasis of thyroid cancer.\n   - **TSH-receptor antibodies (TSH-receptor Ab)**: These are typically used in the diagnosis and management of Graves' disease, an autoimmune thyroid disorder, and are not relevant for monitoring differentiated thyroid cancer.\n\n4. **Clinical guidelines and practice**: Clinical guidelines and standard practice for monitoring recurrence or metastasis of differentiated thyroid cancer (PTC and FTC) after total thyroidectomy recommend the use of thyroglobulin as a key marker.\n\nFinal answer: C: 甲狀腺球蛋白（thyroglobulin）"

Pulmonary function tests indicate obstructive ventilatory impairment. This suggests that the patient has difficulty expelling air from the lungs, which is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases.\n\n2. **DLco Measurement**: The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) is measured at 56% of the predicted value. DLco assesses how well gases can diffuse from the lungs into the blood. A reduced DLco indicates impaired gas exchange, which can be due to several conditions affecting the alveolar-capillary membrane.\n\n3. **Differentiating Between Conditions**:\n   - **Asthma**: Typically presents with reversible airway obstruction and normal or near-normal DLco. Asthma is less likely given the significantly reduced DLco.\n   - **Chronic Bronchitis**: Part of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), characterized by chronic productive cough. DLco is usually normal or only mildly reduced unless there is significant emphysema.\n   - **Emphysema**: Another form of COPD, characterized by destruction of alveolar walls leading to reduced surface area for gas exchange, resulting in a significantly reduced DLco.\n   - **Heart Failure**: Can cause dyspnea and may affect DLco due to pulmonary congestion, but it is not typically associated with obstructive ventilatory impairment.\n\n4. **Most Likely Diagnosis**: Given the obstructive ventilatory impairment and significantly reduced DLco, emphysema is the most likely diagnosis. Emphysema leads to destruction of alveoli, reducing the surface area for gas exchange, which directly correlates with the reduced DLco observed in this patient.\n\nFinal answer: C: 肺氣腫 (Emphysema)"

Stroke can be caused by a variety of factors including hypertension, atherosclerosis, embolism, and inflammatory conditions affecting blood vessels.\n\n2. **Evaluating Each Disease**:\n   - **紅斑性狼瘡 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, SLE)**: SLE is an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and damage to various organs, including blood vessels. This can lead to an increased risk of stroke due to vasculitis, thrombosis, and other vascular complications.\n   - **頸動脈剝離 (Carotid Artery Dissection)**: This condition involves a tear in the carotid artery wall, which can lead to the formation of a blood clot that may travel to the brain and cause a stroke. It is a well-known cause of stroke, particularly in younger individuals.\n   - **高血壓 (Hypertension)**: Hypertension is one of the most significant risk factors for stroke. Chronic high blood pressure can lead to damage of the blood vessel walls, increasing the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.\n   - **類風濕性關節炎 (Rheumatoid Arthritis, RA)**: RA is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints, but it can also have systemic effects, including increased cardiovascular risk. However, while RA can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, its direct association with stroke is less pronounced compared to the other conditions listed.\n\n3. **Comparative Risk Analysis**:\n   - SLE, carotid artery dissection, and hypertension are all directly associated with significant increases in stroke risk due to their direct impact on blood vessels and blood pressure regulation.\n   - RA, while it does increase cardiovascular risk, does not have as strong a direct link to stroke as the other conditions. The primary complications of RA are related to joint damage and systemic inflammation, with secondary cardiovascular risks.\n\nFinal answer: D: 類風濕性關節炎 (Rheumatoid Arthritis)"

The classic symptoms of pellagra are often referred to as the \"three Ds\": diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. If left untreated, it can lead to death.\n\n2. **Option A**: This option states that pellagra is caused by a deficiency of niacin. This is correct, as niacin deficiency is the primary cause of pellagra.\n\n3. **Option B**: This option suggests that niacin is synthesized from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This is incorrect. In fact, NAD+ is synthesized from niacin (or nicotinamide), not the other way around.

These waveforms are typically assessed using Doppler ultrasound to evaluate fetal well-being, particularly in terms of blood flow resistance and potential hypoxia.\n\n2. **Normal vs. Abnormal Waveforms**: \n   - **Normal Waveform**: In a normal umbilical artery waveform, there is a characteristic pattern with a clear systolic peak followed by a diastolic flow. The presence of end-diastolic flow is crucial, indicating low resistance in the placental circulation.\n   - **Abnormal Waveforms**: Abnormal waveforms can include absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF) or reversed end-diastolic flow (REDF), both of which suggest increased placental resistance and potential fetal compromise.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A (甲波形正常，乙、丙波形異常)**: This option suggests that only the waveform labeled 甲 is normal, while 乙 and 丙 are abnormal.\n   - **Option B (甲、乙波形正常，丙波形異常)**: This option suggests that waveforms 甲 and 乙 are normal, while 丙 is abnormal.\n   - **Option C (甲、乙、丙波形皆正常)**: This option suggests that all three waveforms are normal.\n   - **Option D (甲、乙、丙波形皆異常)**: This option suggests that all three waveforms are abnormal.\n\n4. **Visual Analysis of Waveforms**: Without the actual image, we must rely on the typical characteristics of normal and abnormal waveforms:\n   - **甲 (Normal)**: Should show a clear systolic peak and positive end-diastolic flow.\n   - **乙 (Potentially Abnormal)**: If it shows absent or reversed end-diastolic flow, it would be considered abnormal.\n   - **丙 (Potentially Abnormal)**: Similarly, if it shows absent or reversed end-diastolic flow, it would be considered abnormal.\n\n5. **Logical Deduction**: Given the typical patterns:\n   - If 甲 is normal, it should have positive end-diastolic flow.\n   - If 乙 and 丙 are abnormal, they should show absent or reversed end-diastolic flow.\n\nFinal answer: **A: 甲波形正常，乙、丙波形異常**"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Levodopa Metabolism**: Levodopa (L-DOPA) is a precursor to dopamine and is commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, when administered alone, a significant portion of levodopa is metabolized in the peripheral system (outside the brain) by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (also known as DOPA decarboxylase).\n\n2. **Role of Decarboxylase Inhibitors**: To increase the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain, it is often co-administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor.

Treatment often involves surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction.\n\n2. **Surgical Approaches**:\n   - **①可經由開胸與開腹手術施行**: This statement suggests that esophageal achalasia can be treated via thoracic (open chest) and abdominal (open abdomen) surgical approaches. This is correct as both approaches can be used depending on the specific case and surgeon's preference.\n   \n3. **Esophageal Resection and Reconstruction**:\n   - **②大部分必須施行食道切除與重建手術才能解決吞嚥困難的問題**: This statement implies that most cases require esophagectomy (removal of the esophagus) and reconstruction to resolve dysphagia. This is incorrect. Esophagectomy is a more radical procedure and is not typically the first line of treatment for achalasia. Less invasive procedures are preferred.\n\n4. **Muscle Cutting (Myotomy)**:\n   - **③下食道括約肌的肌肉切開術是最常使用的方法**: This statement refers to Heller myotomy, where the muscles of the LES are cut to allow easier passage of food. This is indeed the most common and effective surgical treatment for achalasia.\n\n5. **Fundoplication**:\n   - **④胃底折疊手術 （fundoplication） 有助於減少術後胃液逆流的產生**: This statement is correct. Fundoplication is often performed in conjunction with myotomy to prevent gastroesophageal reflux, which can be a complication after the LES is cut.\n\nFinal answer: **D: ①③④**\n\nThe analysis confirms that statements ①, ③, and ④ are correct, while statement ② is incorrect.

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks about the location of anorectal sensory receptors involved in defecation and flatulence within the layers of the rectum. The rectum, like other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, has several layers: mucosa (黏膜層), submucosa (黏膜下層), muscularis (肌肉層), and serosa (漿膜層).\n\n2. **Function of Anorectal Sensory Receptors**: These receptors are responsible for detecting the presence of stool and gas, which is crucial for initiating the defecation reflex and controlling the passage of gas. Sensory receptors need to be in a position where they can effectively detect changes in the rectal contents.\n\n3. **Layer Functions**:\n   - **Mucosa (黏膜層)**: This is the innermost layer that comes into direct contact with the contents of the rectum. It contains epithelial cells, lamina propria, and a thin layer of muscle (muscularis mucosae). It is rich in sensory receptors that can detect stretch and chemical changes.\n   - **Submucosa (黏膜下層)**: This layer contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. It supports the mucosa and contains the submucosal plexus, which is part of the enteric nervous system.\n   - **Muscularis (肌肉層)**: This layer is responsible for peristalsis and consists of an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of muscle.\n   - **Serosa (漿膜層)**: This is the outermost layer, providing structural support and protection.\n\n4. **Localization of Sensory Receptors**: Sensory receptors for detecting stretch and chemical changes are typically found in the mucosa layer because this layer is in direct contact with the rectal contents and can quickly respond to changes. The submucosa also contains nerve fibers, but the primary sensory detection occurs in the mucosa.\n\nFinal answer: A: 黏膜層"

If untreated, these polyps have a high risk of becoming malignant, leading to colorectal cancer.\n\n2. **Genetic Basis of FAP**: The condition is known to be caused by mutations in specific genes. The most well-documented gene associated with FAP is the APC gene (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli).\n\n3. **Role of APC Gene**: The APC gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and apoptosis. Mutations in the APC gene lead to uncontrolled cell division and polyp formation.\n\n4. **APC/β-catenin Pathway**: The APC protein is involved in the regulation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutations in the APC gene disrupt this regulation, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cell nucleus and promoting the transcription of genes that drive cell proliferation.\n\n5. **Eliminating Other Options**:\n   - **RB Gene**: The RB gene is associated with retinoblastoma and other cancers but not specifically with FAP.\n   - **p53 Gene**: The p53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene involved in many cancers, but it is not primarily linked to FAP.\n   - **TGF-β Receptor**: The TGF-β receptor is involved in cell growth and differentiation, but mutations in this receptor are not the primary cause of FAP.\n\nFinal answer: A: APC/β-catenin"

CO binds to hemoglobin with a much higher affinity than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which impairs oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n2. **Interpreting Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Results**:\n   - **pH 7.32**: Indicates acidemia (normal range: 7.35-7.45).\n   - **PaCO2 38 mmHg**: Within normal range (35-45 mmHg), suggesting that respiratory function is not the primary cause of the acidemia.\n   - **PaO2 86 mmHg**: Slightly lower than normal (80-100 mmHg), but not critically low.\n   - **HCO3- 20 mEq/L**: Slightly low (normal range: 22-26 mEq/L), indicating a metabolic component to the acidemia.\n   - **BEECF -4 mEq/L**: Base excess is negative, supporting metabolic acidosis.\n   - **SaO2 98%**: Indicates high oxygen saturation, but this can be misleading in CO poisoning because standard pulse oximetry cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.\n\n3. **Evaluating Treatment Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Although PaO2 is 86 mmHg, CO poisoning requires high-concentration oxygen therapy to displace CO from hemoglobin.\n   - **Option B**: Correct. High-concentration oxygen therapy is the standard treatment for CO poisoning, and measuring carboxyhemoglobin levels is essential for diagnosis.\n   - **Option C**: Incorrect. SaO2 of 98% does not rule out CO poisoning because pulse oximetry cannot distinguish between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the patient has metabolic acidosis, the primary treatment for CO poisoning is high-concentration oxygen, not sodium bicarbonate.\n\nFinal answer: **B: 先給予高濃度之氧氣治療，並抽血送 carboxyhemoglobin 之檢查**"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Hyperaldosteronism**: Hyperaldosteronism is a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, a hormone that increases sodium retention and potassium excretion, leading to high blood pressure and low blood potassium levels. This condition can be caused by an adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.\n\n2. **Importance of Accurate Localization**: Before surgical intervention, it is crucial to accurately localize the source of excessive aldosterone production. This ensures that the correct adrenal gland or lesion is targeted, minimizing unnecessary surgery and optimizing patient outcomes.\n\n3. **Imaging Modalities for Localization**:\n   - **A: 超音波掃描 (Ultrasound)**: While non-invasive and useful for initial assessment, ultrasound has limited sensitivity in detecting small adrenal lesions or differentiating between adenomas and hyperplasia.\n   - **B: 電腦斷層掃描 (CT Scan)**: CT scans are highly sensitive and specific for detecting adrenal adenomas and hyperplasia. They provide detailed anatomical information and are commonly used in the preoperative evaluation of hyperaldosteronism.\n   - **C: 鉈掃描 (Thallium-201 Scan)**: Thallium-201 scans are typically used in cardiac imaging and have limited application in adrenal imaging. They are not standard for hyperaldosteronism localization.\n   - **D: 血管造影術 (Angiography)**: While angiography can provide detailed vascular information, it is invasive and not typically used as the first-line imaging modality for adrenal lesion localization.\n\n4. **Sensitivity Comparison**: Among the listed options, CT scans are known for their high sensitivity in detecting adrenal adenomas and hyperplasia, making them the preferred choice for preoperative localization in cases of suspected hyperaldosteronism.\n\nFinal answer: B: 電腦斷層掃描 (CT Scan)"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Ribavirin**: Ribavirin is an antiviral medication commonly used in combination with other drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C. It works by inhibiting the replication of the hepatitis C virus.\n\n2. **Common Side Effects of Ribavirin**: Ribavirin has several known side effects. The most significant and common side effect is hemolytic anemia, which is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. This can lead to a decrease in hemoglobin levels and overall red blood cell count.\n\n3. **Evaluating Each Option**:\n   - **Option A: Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation**: This is not a commonly reported side effect of ribavirin. PT prolongation is more associated with liver dysfunction or use of anticoagulants.\n   - **Option B: Anemia**: This is the most common and significant side effect of ribavirin. Hemolytic anemia can lead to severe fatigue and other complications.\n   - **Option C: Leukopenia (White blood cell reduction)**: While ribavirin can cause a decrease in white blood cells, it is not the most prominent side effect.\n   - **Option D: Thrombocytopenia (Platelet reduction)**: Ribavirin can cause a reduction in platelet count, but this is less common compared to anemia.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the known side effects of ribavirin, anemia (specifically hemolytic anemia) is the most significant and common adverse effect.\n\nFinal answer: B: 貧血"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Transcription Factors**: Transcription factors are proteins that help regulate the transcription of DNA to mRNA by binding to specific DNA sequences. They play a crucial role in controlling gene expression.\n\n2. **Identifying the Genes**:\n   - **c-myc**: This gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cellular transformation. It is well-known for its role in cancer development.\n   - **p53**: This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that functions as a transcription factor. It regulates the expression of various genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair.\n   - **bcl-2**: This gene encodes a protein that is primarily involved in regulating apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is not a transcription factor but rather an anti-apoptotic protein that helps cells avoid programmed death.\n\n3. **Comparing the Functions**:\n   - Both c-myc and p53 are transcription factors involved in regulating gene expression.\n   - bcl-2, on the other hand, does not function as a transcription factor. Instead, it plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis by inhibiting cell death.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the functions of these genes, bcl-2 is not a transcription factor, whereas c-myc and p53 are.\n\nFinal answer: C: bcl-2"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Study Design**: The study aims to estimate the prevalence of dementia among elderly individuals (65 years and older) in a community. The method chosen is household visits to assess dementia in those who are 65 years and older.\n\n2. **Identifying the Population**: The target population is all elderly individuals (65 years and older) in the community. However, it is noted that only 70% of these individuals actually reside in their homes, while the remaining 30% do not.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Impact of Non-Residence**: Since the study only assesses those elderly individuals who are at home, it excludes the 30% who do not live at home. This exclusion could lead to a systematic difference between those who live at home and those who do not. For example, those not living at home might be in nursing homes or other care facilities, potentially due to more severe health conditions, including advanced dementia.\n\n4. **Bias Identification**: The exclusion of 30% of the elderly population who do not live at home introduces a bias in the sample. This is because the sample is not representative of the entire elderly population in the community. The prevalence rate calculated from this sample may not accurately reflect the true prevalence in the entire population.\n\n5. **Type of Bias**: The bias introduced by excluding a portion of the population based on their living situation is a form of selection bias. Selection bias occurs when the sample is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed, leading to skewed results.\n\nFinal answer: B: 選樣偏差"

            "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of voluntary muscles. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies that block or destroy many of the muscles' receptor sites for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.\n\n2. **Role of the Thymus in MG**: The thymus gland is involved in the development of the immune system, particularly in the maturation of T-cells, which are crucial for the adaptive immune response. In many patients with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland is abnormal. It may be enlarged (hyperplasia) or contain tumors (thymomas).\n\n3. **Association with Thymus Hyperplasia**: Studies and clinical observations have shown that thymic abnormalities are common in MG patients. Thymic hyperplasia, which is an increase in the number of cells within the thymus, is frequently observed in these patients. This hyperplasia is believed to contribute to the autoimmune response seen in MG.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Organs**:\n   - **Thyroid Gland (B)**: While thyroid disorders can coexist with MG, they are not directly related to the pathogenesis of MG.\n   - **Adrenal Gland (C)**: The adrenal gland is not implicated in the development or exacerbation of MG.\n   - **Bone Marrow Plasma Cells (D)**: Plasma cells in the bone marrow are involved in antibody production but are not specifically linked to the thymic abnormalities seen in MG.\n\nFinal answer: A: 胸腺（thymus）"
