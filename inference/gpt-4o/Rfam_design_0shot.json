This information can be obtained from databases like Rfam, which provides detailed alignments and consensus sequences for RNA families.\n\n3. **Analyze Consensus Sequence and Structure**: The consensus sequence will provide a template that includes conserved regions critical for function and variable regions that can tolerate mutations. The secondary structure will show the pairing interactions that must be maintained for proper folding and function.\n\n4. **Design the RNA Sequence**: Using the consensus sequence and secondary structure, we will design an RNA sequence that adheres to the conserved regions and maintains the necessary secondary structure. We will ensure that the sequence can form the correct secondary structure to function as a cobalamin riboswitch.\n\n5. **Verify the Designed Sequence**: After designing the sequence, we will verify it by checking if it maintains the necessary secondary structure using RNA folding prediction tools like Mfold or RNAfold.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the RNA Family RF00478**:\n   - RF00478 is the cobalamin riboswitch family.\n\n2. **Obtain Consensus Sequence and Structure**:\n   - From the Rfam database, the consensus sequence for RF00478 is:\n     ```\n     GGAUCCGAGUGGGAAGGUGGUGGAGGGGACCCGGAACCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAUCCGGAU"
