Indirect violence, such as a sudden, forceful contraction of the quadriceps muscle, can cause a patella fracture.

    "llm_output": " Analysis:\n1. The term \"治疗指数\" (Therapeutic Index) in pharmacology refers to the ratio between the toxic dose and the therapeutic dose of a drug.\n2. Specifically, it is calculated as the ratio of the median lethal dose (LD50) to the median effective dose (ED50).\n3. The LD50 is the dose that is lethal to 50% of the test population, and the ED50 is the dose that is effective in 50% of the test population.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this ratio, which is LD50/ED50.\n\nFinal answer: C",
