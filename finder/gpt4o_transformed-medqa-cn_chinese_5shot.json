    "llm_output": "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding Viral Meningitis and CSF Characteristics**:\n   - Viral meningitis, also known as aseptic meningitis, typically presents with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that is clear or slightly cloudy. This is in contrast to bacterial meningitis, which often results in turbid CSF due to the presence of a high number of white blood cells (WBCs) and bacteria.\n\n2. **CSF Appearance**:\n   - The appearance of CSF in viral meningitis is usually clear. This is because the inflammatory response is less intense compared to bacterial meningitis, resulting in fewer cells and less protein in the CSF.\n\n3. **CSF Cell Count**:\n   - In viral meningitis, the WBC count in the CSF is typically elevated but not to the extreme levels seen in bacterial meningitis. The count usually ranges from a few dozen to several hundred cells per microliter, predominantly lymphocytes.\n\n4. **Other Diagnostic Tests**:\n   - Options C (墨汁染色) and E (抗酸染色) refer to specific staining techniques used to identify certain pathogens (e.g., Cryptococcus with India ink stain and Mycobacterium with acid-fast stain). These are not standard for diagnosing viral meningitis.\n\n5. **Eliminating Incorrect Options**:\n   - Option B (外观呈毛玻璃样) suggests a frosted glass appearance, which is more typical of bacterial or fungal infections with high protein content and cellular debris.\n   - Option D (脑脊液白细胞数为数百至数千) suggests a very high WBC count, which is more characteristic of bacterial meningitis.\n\nFinal answer: A\n\nThe correct answer is A: 外观清亮的. This is because viral meningitis typically presents with clear CSF, reflecting a less intense inflammatory response compared to bacterial meningitis.",

This condition is often associated with damage to the brain.\n   \n2. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A: 脑外伤 (Brain Injury)**: Brain injuries, especially those involving the hippocampus or other memory-related areas, are well-known causes of retrograde amnesia. Trauma can disrupt the storage and retrieval of memories.\n   - **B: 精神分裂症 (Schizophrenia)**: Schizophrenia primarily affects thought processes, perceptions, and emotional responsiveness. While it can cause cognitive impairments, it is not typically associated with retrograde amnesia.\n   - **C: 焦虑性神经症 (Anxiety Neurosis)**: Anxiety disorders generally do not cause memory loss of past events. They are more related to excessive worry and fear about future events.\n   - **D: 老年性痴呆 (Senile Dementia)**: Senile dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, can cause both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. However, it is more commonly associated with the gradual loss of memory over time rather than sudden retrograde amnesia.\n   - **E: 抑郁症 (Depression)**: Depression can lead to memory issues, but these are usually related to concentration and the ability to form new memories rather than the loss of past memories.\n\n3. **Identifying the Most Likely Cause**: Among the options, brain injury (脑外伤) is the most direct and well-documented cause of retrograde amnesia.

    "llm_output": "Analysis:\n1. **Understanding the Types of Femoral Neck Fractures**: The femoral neck can be fractured in several ways, and the stability of these fractures varies. The main types include:\n   - **外展型 (Abduction type)**: This type of fracture occurs when the leg is in an abducted position. It is generally considered more stable because the bone fragments are less likely to displace.\n   - **内收型 (Adduction type)**: This type occurs when the leg is in an adducted position. It is typically less stable because the bone fragments are more prone to displacement.\n   - **头下型 (Subcapital type)**: This fracture is located just below the head of the femur. It is often unstable due to the proximity to the blood supply.\n   - **基底型 (Basicervical type)**: This fracture occurs at the base of the femoral neck.
