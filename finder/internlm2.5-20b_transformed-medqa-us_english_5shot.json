However, a rhinovirus-specific, cell-mediated immune response is not directly triggered by the activation of interferon.

What would you expect to be happening in the phases and the respective muscles of interest?\nA: Recruitment of small motor units at the start of experiments 1 and 2\nB: Increase of tension in experiments 2 and 3, with the same underlying mechanism\nC: Recruitment of large motor units followed by small motor units in experiment 1\nD: Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments\nE: Increase of tension in all phases",
    "llm_output": "Analysis:\n1. In the first phase, the participant is lifting a weight, which is a static activity that requires sustained contraction of the biceps muscle. This would involve the recruitment of motor units, starting with small ones and progressing to larger ones as the force required increases.\n2. In the second phase, the participant is doing burpees, which is an aerobic exercise that increases heart rate and cardiac output. This would primarily involve the contraction of cardiac muscle, which has a different mechanism of contraction compared to skeletal muscle.\n3. In the third phase, the participant's gastrocnemius muscle is electrically stimulated at a frequency of 50 Hz, which is likely to result in a fused tetanic contraction, where the muscle remains contracted without relaxation.\n\nFinal answer: C",

    "question": "Two days after an uncomplicated laparoscopic abdominal hernia repair, a 46-year-old man is evaluated for palpitations. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a ventricular septal defect that closed spontaneously as a child. His father has coronary artery disease. Prior to admission, his only medications were hydrochlorothiazide and metformin. He currently also takes hydromorphone/acetaminophen for mild postoperative pain. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.0°C (99°F), blood pressure is 139/85 mmHg, pulse is 75/min and irregular, and respirations are 14/min. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs and clear lung fields. The abdominal incisions are clean, dry, and intact. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown below. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ECG findings?\nA: Hypokalemia\nB: Obesity\nC: Accessory pathway in the heart\nD: Hydromorphone administration\nE: Acute myocardial ischemia\nF: Atrial enlargement",
    "llm_output": "Analysis:\n1. The patient's ECG shows a short PR interval, a narrow QRS complex, and a regular tachycardia with a rate of 75/min. These findings are consistent with a supraventricular tachycardia.\n2. The patient's history of a ventricular septal defect that closed spontaneously as a child and a family history of coronary artery disease suggest the presence of an accessory pathway in the heart, which can lead to supraventricular tachycardias.\n3. The patient's recent laparoscopic abdominal hernia repair and postoperative pain management with hydromorphone/acetaminophen are not likely to be the primary cause of the ECG findings, as they do not typically cause such changes.\n\nFinal answer: C.
