Numbness on shaving is typically associated with injury to a sensory nerve.

During etching, the dentin surface is treated with an acidic solution, which removes the smear layer and exposes the underlying collagen fibres.\n3. This process also opens up the dentinal tubules, creating a roughened surface that increases the surface energy and enhances the bonding of dental materials.\n4.

    "llm_output": "Analysis:\n1. Finger spring is a type of orthodontic appliance used to tip a tooth, typically in cases of severe tipping or when space is needed for an impacted tooth.\n2. When a finger spring is applied to the crown of a tooth, it exerts a force that tends to tip the tooth in the direction of the spring.\n3. The root of the tooth, however, tends to move in the opposite direction, away from the crown. This is due to the resistance of the periodontal ligament and the bone surrounding the root.\n4. This movement of the root apex can lead to various complications, including root resorption, bone loss, and damage to the supporting structures of the tooth.\n\nFinal answer: C.
