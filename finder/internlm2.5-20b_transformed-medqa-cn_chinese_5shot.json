The question presents a 10-month-old female infant with a history of sudden抽搐 (seizure) and relevant physical examination findings such as a head circumference of 45cm, a flat anterior fontanelle, and a temperature of 38.5℃. The blood test results show low levels of calcium and phosphorus.\n2. The key information to consider is the infant's age, the presence of a seizure, and the abnormal blood test results for calcium and phosphorus. These findings suggest a possible underlying condition related to electrolyte imbalances or a neurological issue.\n3. Given the infant's age and the abnormal blood test results, the most likely cause of the seizure is a calcium deficiency, as indicated by the low blood calcium level of 1.75mmol/L (7mg/dL).\n\nFinal answer: D. 低钙惊厥 (Hypocalcemic seizure)",
