This can be done through in vitro susceptibility testing, where the molecule is exposed to A. baumannii and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is determined.\n3. If the molecule demonstrates a low MIC value, indicating effective inhibition of A. baumannii growth, it can be considered potent. Conversely, if the MIC value is high, suggesting limited or no inhibition, the molecule would be considered not potent.\n\nFinal answer: Not potent directly",
