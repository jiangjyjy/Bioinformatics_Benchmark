Typically, a lower binding energy (more negative value) indicates a stronger binding affinity.\n   - Establish a threshold for binding affinity based on empirical data or literature. For instance, a binding energy below -7 kcal/mol might be considered indicative of significant binding affinity.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Based on the binding affinity score, determine if the drug has a significant binding affinity to the target protein.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for computational tools to perform these steps, a direct answer without performing these simulations would be speculative. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have performed these steps and obtained the necessary data.\n\nFinal answer: 0 (assuming no significant binding affinity was found based on hypothetical docking results)",
