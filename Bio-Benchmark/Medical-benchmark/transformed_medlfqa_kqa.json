Examples include chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and selective IgA deficiency. Secondary immunodeficiencies are acquired throughout a person's life and can result from various causes. Chronic diseases like autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), malignancies (leukemia, multiple myeloma), hepatic or renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus can impair immune system function. Medical treatments like corticosteroids, certain chemotherapies, treatments for organ transplantation rejection, and biological therapies can also cause immunodeficiencies. Infections like HIV, measles, herpes viruses, bacterial, mycobacterial, and parasitic infections can weaken the immune system. Malnutrition, burns, pregnancy, stress, asplenia, environmental radiation and toxin exposure, and old age have also been linked to a weakened immune system and increased infection risk.",
