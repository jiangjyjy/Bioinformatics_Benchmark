One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines.
